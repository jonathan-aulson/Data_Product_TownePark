# Documentation Strategy for Towne Park Financial Systems

## Current State Analysis

The current documentation includes a wealth of information about Towne Park's financial systems, particularly focused on:

1. **Billing System (PowerBill)** - A system built on Microsoft Dataverse for customer invoicing
2. **Forecasting System** - A newer system also built on Dataverse for financial forecasting
3. **Contract Management** - Various deal types and business rules for different contract structures
4. **Technical Architecture** - Information about frontend/backend stacks, integrations, and data flows
5. **Business Processes** - Workflows for billing, forecasting, approvals, and financial management
6. **User Stories** - Detailed acceptance criteria for system features
7. **Meeting Notes** - Various transcripts from backlog grooming, sprint demos, and discovery sessions

The documentation is currently organized in various formats (markdown files, Word documents) with inconsistent structure, making it challenging to maintain and leverage for AI assistance.

## Documentation Strategy Recommendations

### 2. YAML Front Matter Standard

I recommend standardizing the YAML front matter across all document types with these common fields:

```yaml
---
title: "Descriptive document title"
description: "1-2 sentence summary of the document"
created_date: YYYY-MM-DD
last_updated_date: YYYY-MM-DD
version: 1.0
status: [Draft/In Review/Approved]
owner: "Document Owner's Name"
contributors: 
  - "Contributor 1"
  - "Contributor 2"
systems:
  - Billing
  - Forecasting
tags:
  - tag1
  - tag2
  - tag3
---
```

Additional fields specific to document types:

- **Technical documents**: `components`, `languages`, `frameworks`
- **Business rules**: `business_domains`, `contract_types`, `effective_date`
- **User processes**: `user_roles`, `frequency`, `prerequisites`
- **Configuration guides**: `configuration_areas`, `environment_specific`

### 3. Metadata Tagging Library

### 4. Document Organization Structure

I recommend organizing the documentation into a hierarchical structure:

```
towne-park-documentation/
├── README.md                       # Project overview and navigation guide
├── systems/                        # System-level documentation

│   └── system-settings/            # System settings configuration
└── glossary.md                     # Terminology definitions
```

### 5. Cross-Referencing Strategy

To ensure documentation is deeply cross-referenced:

1. **Consistent Linking Format**: Use relative links with descriptive text:
   ```markdown
   See the [Revenue Share Calculation Rules](../../business-rules/contract-types/revenue-share.md#calculation-rules) for details.
   ```

2. **"Related Documents" Sections**: End each document with a Related Documents section:
   ```markdown
   ## Related Documents
   - [Revenue Share Contract Setup](../../configuration/contract-setup/revenue-share.md)
   - [Billing Admin Invoice Generation](../../user-processes/billing-admin/generate-invoices.md)
   - [Validation Threshold Rules](../../business-rules/billing/validation.md)
   ```

3. **Tag-Based Discovery**: Include relevant tags in the YAML front matter to enable finding related documents by tag.

4. **Version Cross-References**: When referencing specific versions of related documents:
   ```markdown
   See [Revenue Share Calculation Rules v2.1](../../business-rules/contract-types/revenue-share.md) (as of 2025-03-15).
   ```

### 6. Documentation Automation

To create a "flywheel effect" for continuous improvement:

1. **CI/CD Pipeline for Documentation**:
   - Validate document structure (correct YAML front matter, proper links)
   - Generate table of contents
   - Create cross-reference indexes
   - Check for broken links
   - Create visualizations from tagged data

2. **Metadata Extraction**:
   - Automatically extract metadata from documents
   - Build a searchable index of all documents
   - Generate relationship graphs between documents based on tags and links

3. **Documentation Analytics**:
   - Track document usage and references
   - Identify gaps in documentation coverage
   - Highlight outdated documents needing review

4. **AI-Assisted Documentation Generation**:
   - Auto-suggest related documents when creating new content
   - Generate document outlines based on similar documents
   - Summarize technical content for non-technical audiences

## Implementation Plan

1. **Phase 1: Template Creation & Initial Structure**
   - Create document templates
   - Define metadata taxonomy
   - Establish folder structure
   - Set up basic CI/CD for validation

2. **Phase 2: Document Migration & Enhancement**
   - Migrate existing documents to new templates
   - Add missing metadata
   - Create cross-references between documents
   - Fill in documentation gaps

3. **Phase 3: Automation & Continuous Improvement**
   - Implement advanced CI/CD features
   - Create documentation analytics dashboard
   - Set up regular review cycles
   - Implement AI-assisted documentation tools

4. **Phase 4: User Adoption & Feedback**
   - Train users on documentation system
   - Collect feedback on documentation quality
   - Iterate on templates and structure
   - Measure impact on development and support efficiency

## Conclusion

This comprehensive documentation strategy will transform Towne Park's documentation into a well-structured, metadata-rich, and deeply cross-referenced knowledge base. By treating documentation as code and leveraging automation, we can create a sustainable system that continuously improves with the help of AI, while providing value to both human users and AI assistants.
