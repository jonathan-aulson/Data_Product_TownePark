# Cyclical Documentation Transformation Protocol

## üéØ CYCLICAL TRANSFORMATION OBJECTIVE

You are tasked with executing a continuous documentation transformation process that automatically cycles through available documents while managing token consumption efficiently and maintaining documentation ecosystem health. This protocol enables sustained documentation processing with intelligent resource management and proactive quality assurance.

## üîÑ CYCLICAL PROCESS OVERVIEW

### **CYCLE INITIALIZATION**
1. **Token Assessment**: Check current token availability and establish safety thresholds
2. **Document Discovery**: Scan Current_State_Data_Product folder for available documents
3. **Documentation Health Check**: Assess overall documentation ecosystem health and navigation integrity
4. **Cycle Decision**: Determine if sufficient tokens exist for a complete transformation cycle
5. **Execution or Termination**: Proceed with transformation or inform user of insufficient tokens

### **TRANSFORMATION CYCLE EXECUTION**
If sufficient tokens are available (minimum 15,000 tokens recommended for safe cycle completion):
1. Execute complete transformation process following Enhanced AI Prompt guidelines
2. Monitor token consumption throughout the process
3. Upon completion, reassess token availability for next cycle
4. Perform documentation ecosystem health assessment
5. Automatically initiate next cycle or terminate with status report

## üìã ENHANCED CYCLICAL TASK DEFINITION

### **PRIMARY TASK INSTRUCTIONS**

I want you to execute a cyclical documentation transformation process with the following steps:

1. **Token Management Check**: Assess current token availability and determine if sufficient tokens remain for a complete transformation cycle (minimum 15,000 tokens recommended)

2. **Cycle Decision Logic**:
   - **IF sufficient tokens available**: Proceed with transformation cycle
   - **IF insufficient tokens remaining**: Terminate and report status with token information

3. **Transformation Execution** (if proceeding):
   - Read the files in the directory ".../ai-prompts/" and understand the transformation instructions
   - List files in Current_State_Data_Product folder to see available options
   - Pick AT RANDOM any 1 (at most) file from the folder "Current_State_Data_Product"
   - Follow the Enhanced AI Prompt guidelines for complete transformation
   - Save resulting documentation in appropriate docs folder location
   - Update navigation (mkdocs.yml and docs/index.md)
   - Move processed file from Current_State_Data_Product to Processed_Files folder
   - Verify compliance with all transformation rules

4. **Documentation Ecosystem Health Assessment** (PERIODIC - Execute only when conditions are met):
   - **Trigger Conditions**: Execute this assessment only when:
     - Every 5th cycle completion (to avoid overwhelming the process)
     - OR when mkdocs warnings are detected during navigation updates
     - OR when significant navigation inconsistencies are identified
   - **Documentation Structure Analysis**: Evaluate overall documentation organization for AI and human usability
   - **Link Integrity Assessment**: Check for broken or missing document references
   - **Navigation Optimization Review**: Assess navigation structure and organization effectiveness
   - **User Approval Requirement**: Before making major structural changes, present plan and request user approval with specific confirmation phrase

5. **Cycle Completion Assessment**:
   - Report transformation outcome
   - Check remaining token availability
   - Automatically initiate next cycle if tokens permit
   - Terminate with status report if tokens insufficient

## üéØ OPTIMIZED CYCLICAL PROCESS DESIGN

### **Token Management Strategy**
- **Safety Threshold**: Maintain minimum 15,000 tokens for complete cycle
- **Monitoring Points**: Check tokens before cycle start and after completion
- **Termination Logic**: Stop processing when tokens fall below safety threshold
- **Status Reporting**: Provide clear information about token status and processing capability

### **Cycle Efficiency Optimization**
Target: Reduce to ~12-15 API requests per cycle (35-40% reduction from baseline)

#### **Phase 1: Batch Reading Operations**
Target: 2 batch read operations per cycle
- Single read_file request for: transformation instructions + source document + mkdocs.yml + docs/index.md + key Power Platform files (up to 5 files)
- Second read_file request if more than 5 files needed for validation

#### **Phase 2: Coordinated Navigation Updates**
Target: 2 coordinated operations per cycle
- Read both navigation files together in Phase 1
- Plan all navigation changes during analysis phase
- Update both mkdocs.yml and docs/index.md with coordinated apply_diff operations

#### **Phase 3: Streamlined Document Creation**
Target: X write operations per cycle (unavoidable - each document is unique)
- Document creation cannot be further optimized without sacrificing quality
- Each document serves a distinct purpose and requires individual file creation

#### **Phase 4: Efficient File Management**
Target: 1 combined operation per cycle
- Use execute_command to move file and verify in single operation
- Combine move and verification into one step

#### **Phase 5: Periodic Health Assessment**
Target: 2-3 additional operations per 5th cycle (when triggered)
- Batch read navigation files and representative documents for health assessment
- Execute approved improvements with minimal additional requests
- Report health status and recommendations

### **Enhanced Cyclical Workflow**
New ~12-15 Request Process Per Cycle (with periodic health assessment):

1. **Cycle Assessment** (1 request): Token check and document availability
2. **Batch Context Gathering** (1 request): Read transformation instructions + source document + mkdocs.yml + docs/index.md + 1 Power Platform file
3. **Additional Validation Reading** (1 request, if needed): Read remaining Power Platform files for validation context
4. **Document Creation** (X requests - unavoidable): Create each focused document individually
5. **Coordinated Navigation Updates** (2 requests): Update mkdocs.yml and docs/index.md with all new document references
6. **File Management** (1 request): Move processed file and verify completion
7. **Health Assessment** (2-3 requests, every 5th cycle): Evaluate documentation ecosystem health and implement approved improvements
8. **Cycle Completion Assessment** (1 request): Final compliance verification and cycle continuation decision

## üîÑ CYCLICAL EXECUTION LOGIC

### **Token Management Implementation**

```markdown
**CYCLE START LOGIC:**
1. Check current token availability
2. If tokens >= 15,000: Proceed with transformation cycle
3. If tokens < 15,000: Terminate with status report

**CYCLE COMPLETION LOGIC:**
1. Complete transformation and report outcome
2. Check remaining token availability
3. If tokens >= 15,000: Automatically initiate next cycle
4. If tokens < 15,000: Terminate with comprehensive status report
```

### **Health Assessment Integration**

```markdown
**HEALTH ASSESSMENT TRIGGER LOGIC:**
1. Track cycle completion count
2. Monitor for mkdocs warnings during navigation updates
3. Detect navigation inconsistencies during transformation
4. Execute health assessment only when triggered (not every cycle)

**HEALTH ASSESSMENT EXECUTION:**
1. Analyze documentation structure and navigation effectiveness
2. Identify optimization opportunities
3. If major changes needed: Present plan and request user approval
4. If minor improvements: Execute automatically
5. If no changes needed: Report healthy status and continue
```

### **Automated Cycle Continuation**

```markdown
**CONTINUATION DECISION MATRIX:**
- **High Token Availability** (25,000+ tokens): Proceed with next cycle immediately
- **Moderate Token Availability** (15,000-24,999 tokens): Proceed with next cycle with caution
- **Low Token Availability** (5,000-14,999 tokens): Terminate and report status
- **Critical Token Availability** (<5,000 tokens): Terminate immediately and report status

**HEALTH ASSESSMENT IMPACT:**
- **Health Check Due**: Factor additional token requirements for health assessment
- **Optimization Approved**: Include optimization tasks in token calculation
- **Major Changes Pending**: Prioritize optimization over new transformations
```

### **Status Reporting Requirements**

For each cycle completion, provide:
- **Documents Processed**: Number of files transformed in current session
