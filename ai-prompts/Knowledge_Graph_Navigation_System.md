# Knowledge Graph-Based Navigation System

## Overview

The Knowledge Graph-Based Navigation System provides intelligent, context-aware navigation that dynamically organizes content based on discovered relationships, user context, and enterprise knowledge graph structure. This system transforms static navigation into a living, adaptive interface that evolves with the knowledge base.
