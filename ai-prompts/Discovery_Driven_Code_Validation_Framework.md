# Discovery-Driven Code Validation Framework

## Overview

The Discovery-Driven Code Validation Framework implements systematic, autonomous code validation processes that are directly informed by enterprise knowledge discovery results. This framework ensures that all business rules, technical specifications, and integration points documented in the knowledge graph are accurately implemented in the source code.

## Framework Architecture

### **1. Discovery Integration Engine**

```yaml
discovery_integration:
  knowledge_graph_interface:
    connection_type: "Real-time API"
    data_sources:
      - "Enterprise Knowledge Graph"
      - "Source Code Map"
      - "Business Rules Repository"
      - "Technical Specifications"
      - "Integration Documentation"
    
    query_capabilities:
      - "Entity relationship traversal"
      - "Business rule extraction"
      - "Technical specification lookup"
      - "Integration point identification"
      - "Validation target prioritization"
  
  validation_target_identification:
    automatic_discovery:
      - "Business rule implementations"
      - "Calculation engine components"
      - "Integration point handlers"
      - "Data validation logic"
      - "Workflow orchestration code"
    
    priority_classification:
      critical: "Financial calculations, business rule enforcement"
      high: "Data validation, integration logic, security controls"
      medium: "User interface logic, reporting algorithms"
      low: "Utility functions, configuration management"
    
    confidence_scoring:
      high_confidence: "Multiple documentation sources, clear implementation path"
      medium_confidence: "Single documentation source, some ambiguity"
      low_confidence: "Inferred requirements, significant ambiguity"
      uncertain: "Conflicting documentation, unclear requirements"
```
