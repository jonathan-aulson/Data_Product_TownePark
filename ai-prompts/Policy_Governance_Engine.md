# Towne Park Policy Governance Engine

## Overview

The Policy Governance Engine provides embedded governance controls for all autonomous decision-making processes within the Towne Park financial systems. It implements real-time policy validation, automatic constraint enforcement, and comprehensive compliance monitoring with enhanced FIBO financial ontology integration.

## Policy Governance Architecture
