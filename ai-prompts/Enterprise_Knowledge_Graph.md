# Towne Park Enterprise Knowledge Graph

## Overview

The Towne Park Enterprise Knowledge Graph serves as the foundational infrastructure for autonomous context discovery, policy-governed decision making, and comprehensive enterprise knowledge management. This system implements the revolutionary capabilities defined in the Autonomous Context AI Protocol v4.0.
