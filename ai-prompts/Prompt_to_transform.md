I want you to read the files in the directory ".../ai-prompts/" and know they are talking to you about your task.

Then, I want you to ensure that the following concepts are correctly implemented in those 'ai-prompts' files so that the processes described here will be followed to their maximum success and in the order of priority shown here;
1. PRESERVATION OF INFORMATION, NEVER SUMMERIZATION NOR ELIMINATION
2. Creating and transforming documentation is fun, and getting it perfect is enjoyable
3. Validating the documentation against relevant source code files is vital, and finding the right source code to validate the documentation against is the key to being successful at this process
4. Ensuring that the taxonomy and ontology of the documentation is well-represented in the metadata and navigation links is absolutely crucial to producing good and usable documentation, and the key to this is careful planning of future documents, rigorous validation of existing documents, rich use of relevant metadata, and exacting standards in linking information to other relevant information. Another key aspect of this is to frequently check on the health of the mkdocs server and any warning messages that exist, and ensure those issues are addressed quickly with better linking and better metadata whenever possible.
5. Our effort needs to be spent wisely, we need to conserve tokens when it comes to interactions with the Documentation Team (me, the user) and wisely invest tokens into the efforts of creating excellent documentation.  One aspect of this is to only report outcomes of any kind every 5 cycles or so, thus focusing effort on the documentation and not the reporting of our process.
6. Our task is to fully transform the Current_State_Data_Product files and locate new files into Future_State_Data_Product directory and to do this will take many cycles so you should continue to transform without stopping, merely repeating the process again and again until it needs to be interrupted with reporting or a health concern.
7. DOCUMENT TRANSFORMATION PRIORITIZATION: Process documents in strict priority order: (1) Meeting transcripts and team notes FIRST, (2) Other project artifacts SECOND, (3) Contract JSON files LAST
8. MANDATORY DOCUMENT VERSIONING: EVERY document modification MUST increment the version number in frontmatter and update last_updated_date - NO EXCEPTIONS

Once you have made updates anywhere in the 'ai-prompts' files that is appropriate, continue per the below;

Then, I want you to pick files from the folder "Current_State_Data_Product" following STRICT PRIORITY ORDER: (1) Meeting transcripts from Processed_Meeting_Transcripts folder FIRST, (2) Other project artifacts SECOND, (3) Contract JSON files LAST. Once the document has been transformed, and you have Saved the resulting new documentation somewhere inside the folder structure found in "docs" folder (wherever most appropriate based on their content), updated the navigation, INCREMENTED THE VERSION NUMBER, and thoroughly verified that you've complied with the rules, I want to you Move the files from Current_State_Data_Product into the Data_Product_TownePark/Processed_Files folder and report your outcome.

To summarize the instructions another way, please see below list.
Initialize ToDo List for Task:
Read and understand ai-prompts transformation instructions
List files in Current_State_Data_Product folder to see available options
Select 1 file from Current_State_Data_Product folder following PRIORITY ORDER (meeting transcripts first, then other artifacts, then contract JSON files last)
Read and analyze the selected file following the Enhanced AI Prompt guidelines
Perform content inventory and quality assessment
Transform the document according to the transformation protocol
Validate against Power Platform code when applicable
Save transformed documentation in appropriate docs folder location
MANDATORY: Increment version number and update last_updated_date in frontmatter
Update mkdocs.yml navigation
Update docs/index.md navigation elements
Move processed file from Current_State_Data_Product to Processed_Files folder
Verify compliance with all transformation rules including versioning
Do not report anything regarding transformation outcome until only after the fifth full cycle of all above tasks - then consolidate all information into one report and wait for user input to continue
