# Knowledge Corpus Daily Update - 2025-08-08

## Overview

This document tracks the daily knowledge corpus transformation and enhancement activities performed on August 8, 2025, focusing on YAML front-matter standardization and template compliance across all Markdown files.

## Activities Completed

### YAML Front-matter Standardization
- Analyzed existing front-matter structures across all knowledge corpus files
- Identified template compliance gaps and inconsistencies
- Applied standardized YAML front-matter template from architecture vision
- Ensured all required fields are present and correctly formatted

### Files Processed
- `docs/index.md` - Already compliant with standardized template
- `docs/ai-protocol-compliance-validation.md` - Already compliant with standardized template
- `docs/knowledge-corpus-architecture-vision.md` - Already compliant with standardized template
- Knowledge corpus subdirectory files - Enhanced for full template compliance

### Quality Assurance
- Validated YAML syntax correctness across all files
- Verified content integrity preservation during refactoring
- Confirmed all required metadata fields are populated
- Ensured FIBO classification consistency

## Next Steps

- Continue monitoring for template compliance
- Regular validation of YAML front-matter syntax
- Ongoing enhancement of metadata richness
- Integration with automated quality checks

*This daily update ensures the knowledge corpus maintains the highest standards of organization, metadata richness, and template compliance as specified in the architectural vision.*
