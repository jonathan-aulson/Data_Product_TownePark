## :material-brain: AI-Optimized Architecture

### **Autonomous Context Discovery**
This knowledge corpus is architected specifically for AI-assisted development and autonomous context discovery, implementing the principles from the [Towne Park Autonomous Context AI Protocol](knowledge-corpus/enterprise-context/autonomous-discovery-guide.md).

### **FIBO Financial Ontology Integration**
All financial entities are classified using the Financial Industry Business Ontology (FIBO) with Towne Park domain-specific extensions, enabling precise business context understanding and automated relationship discovery.

### **Enterprise Knowledge Graph**
The corpus structure supports enterprise knowledge graph generation with:
- **Entity-centric organization** around business concepts
- **Relationship-dense linking** for contextual understanding  
- **Policy-governed validation** for trustworthy AI decisions
- **Multi-dimensional cross-references** for comprehensive context

## :material-compass: AI-First Navigation Principles

| AI Optimization Strategy | Human Navigation Benefit | Implementation |
|:--------------------------|:-------------------------|:---------------|
| **Entity-Centric Organization** | Clear business concept focus | Content grouped by business entities rather than system boundaries |
| **Relationship-Dense Linking** | Comprehensive cross-references | Every document links to related concepts, systems, and processes |
| **FIBO Classification** | Standardized financial terminology | Financial concepts classified using industry-standard ontology |
| **Contextual Metadata** | Rich document information | Extensive frontmatter with entity classifications and relationships |
| **Validation Integration** | Quality assurance visibility | Code validation reports directly linked to business rule documentation |

## :material-folder-multiple: Knowledge Corpus Structure

The AI-optimized knowledge corpus is organized into eight primary domains:

### **1. Enterprise Context** 
Foundation layer providing business entity registry, relationship mappings, and AI discovery guides

### **2. Financial Entities**
FIBO-enhanced business entities including contracts, revenue classifications, and business processes

### **3. System Architecture** 
Technical implementation context covering integration patterns and platform architecture

### **4. Role-Based Processes**
User-centric workflows organized by job function and responsibility

### **5. Validation Reports**
Code validation and quality assurance documentation with business rule verification

### **6. Meeting Transcripts**
Development context and decision documentation from planning and development sessions

### **7. Standards Framework**
Governance and standards covering development, business, and AI-specific protocols

### **8. Configuration Guides**
System setup and configuration documentation for all platform components
