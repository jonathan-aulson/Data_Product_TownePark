**Calculation Formula:** Invalidation_Trigger = Source_Data_Change OR TTL_Expiration OR Manual_Override OR System_Event  
**Examples:**
- Source data modification triggers immediate cache invalidation for affected datasets
- Scheduled TTL expiration triggers automatic cache refresh
- Manual override allows administrators to force cache refresh for data corrections
- System maintenance events trigger comprehensive cache clearing
**Source:** Decision D032 from 2025-06-25 backlog grooming session  
**Implementation:** Event-driven cache invalidation with audit logging  
**Edge Cases:**
- Cascade invalidation for related data dependencies
