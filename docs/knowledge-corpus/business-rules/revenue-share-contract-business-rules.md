# Revenue Share Contract Business Rules

## Overview

This document contains comprehensive business rules and specifications for revenue share contract types within the Towne Park financial systems. Revenue share contracts represent agreements where Towne Park receives a percentage of the total revenue generated from parking operations or other revenue-generating activities.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Percentage-based compensation structure
- Progressive tier calculations for revenue thresholds
- Multiple revenue code classifications (SD1/SD2, VD1/VD2, VO1/VO2, OR1/OR2)
- Deposited revenue vs. client collection models
- Power Platform formula implementation with validation

## Contract Definition

## Business Rules

### Core Revenue Share Calculation Rules

- **Rule RS-001**: Revenue share = Gross Revenue Ã— Revenue Share Percentage
- **Rule RS-002**: Owner percentage = 100% - Towne Park percentage (with zero floor protection)
- **Rule RS-003**: Minimum guarantee applies when calculated share is below minimum
- **Rule RS-004**: Revenue categories are calculated separately if different percentages apply

### Progressive Tier Calculation Rules

- **Rule RS-005**: Progressive tiers apply incremental percentage increases at defined thresholds
- **Rule RS-006**: IF monthly_revenue > $50K THEN base_rate + 2% tier adjustment
- **Rule RS-007**: IF monthly_revenue > $100K THEN base_rate + 5% tier adjustment
- **Rule RS-008**: Tier calculations are cumulative and apply to revenue within each tier range

### Revenue Code Processing Rules

- **Rule RS-009**: SD1/SD2 revenue codes processed as daily parking revenue
- **Rule RS-010**: VD1/VD2 revenue codes processed as valet daily service revenue
- **Rule RS-011**: VO1/VO2 revenue codes processed as valet overnight service revenue
- **Rule RS-012**: OR1/OR2 revenue codes processed as bell service revenue with special integration

### Revenue Recognition Rules

- **Rule RS-013**: Only contracted revenue categories are included in calculations
- **Rule RS-014**: Revenue must be validated and verified before calculation
- **Rule RS-015**: Adjustments and refunds are deducted from gross revenue
- **Rule RS-016**: Revenue is recognized in the period it is earned

### Deposited Revenue Processing Rules

- **Rule RS-017**: Deposited revenue model: Towne Park collects and remits owner portion
- **Rule RS-018**: Client collection model: Client collects and remits Towne Park portion
- **Rule RS-019**: Collection model determines revenue processing workflow and timing
- **Rule RS-020**: Revenue validation requirements vary by collection model

### Validation Rules

- **Rule RS-021**: Revenue share percentage must be between 0% and 100%
- **Rule RS-022**: Owner percentage calculation must include zero floor protection
- **Rule RS-023**: Minimum guarantees cannot exceed maximum possible revenue share
- **Rule RS-024**: All revenue must be supported by documentation
- **Rule RS-025**: Vehicle count validation required for occupancy-based calculations

## Progressive Tier Structures

### Standard Tier Configuration

**Tier 1: Base Revenue (0 - $50,000)**

### Tier Calculation Methodology

**Progressive Calculation Example:**
```
Monthly Revenue: $120,000
Base Rate: 15%

Tier 1 (0-50K): $50,000 Ã— 15% = $7,500
Tier 2 (50K-100K): $50,000 Ã— 17% = $8,500
Tier 3 (100K+): $20,000 Ã— 20% = $4,000
Total Revenue Share: $20,000
```
