# AI-Assisted Sprint Planning Process Guide

## Document Overview

This guide establishes the process for conducting AI-assisted sprint planning sessions within the Towne Park development team. Based on Sprint 28 planning session conducted on June 18, 2025, this document outlines the methodology for integrating AI tools into sprint planning, story prioritization, and task breakdown activities.

## Executive Summary

AI-assisted sprint planning enhances traditional agile planning by leveraging AI tools for task breakdown, story analysis, and development workflow optimization. The process includes structured planning sessions followed by AI-assisted tasking sessions to maximize development efficiency and ensure comprehensive task coverage.

## Sprint Planning Process Framework

### 1. Pre-Planning Preparation

#### 1.1 Story Prioritization

**Process Owner:** Business Analyst (Jonathan Aulson)  
**Duration:** 30-60 minutes before planning session  
**Deliverables:** Prioritized story backlog with business context  

**Preparation Steps:**
1. **Business Priority Assessment**
   - Review business objectives and deadlines
   - Identify highest-value features for upcoming sprint
   - Consider resource constraints and dependencies

2. **Story Readiness Validation**
   - Ensure stories have clear acceptance criteria
   - Validate business requirements are complete
   - Confirm technical feasibility assessments

3. **Resource Allocation Planning**
   - Assess team capacity and availability
   - Identify potential resource constraints
   - Plan for skill-specific work distribution

**Example from Sprint 28:**
> "Sprint planning for Sprint 28. We've got a couple old classics that have come back. This is the Internal Revenue story continuing on with management agreement and per labor hour. This is probably my highest priority for us to get through."

#### 1.2 Technical Context Preparation

**Process Owner:** Development Team Lead  
**Duration:** 15-30 minutes  
**Deliverables:** Technical readiness assessment  

**Technical Preparation:**
- Review previous sprint completion status
- Identify technical dependencies and blockers
- Assess development environment readiness
- Prepare AI tool configurations for the session

### 2. Sprint Planning Session

#### 2.1 Planning Session Structure

**Duration:** 60-90 minutes  
**Participants:** Full development team + Business Analyst  
**Format:** Collaborative discussion with AI tool preparation  

**Session Agenda:**
1. **Sprint Goal Setting** (15 minutes)
   - Business context and priorities
   - Sprint objectives and success criteria
   - Resource availability confirmation

2. **Story Review and Estimation** (30-45 minutes)
   - Story walkthrough with business context
   - Initial complexity assessment
   - Dependency identification

3. **Capacity Planning** (15-20 minutes)
   - Team capacity assessment
   - Work distribution planning
   - Risk identification

4. **AI-Assisted Tasking Preparation** (10-15 minutes)
   - Tool configuration verification
   - Context material preparation
   - Tasking session scheduling

#### 2.2 Story Prioritization Methodology

**High Priority Indicators:**
- Business-critical functionality
- Customer-facing features
- Dependency blockers for other teams
- Technical debt with immediate impact

**Resource Constraint Management:**
```
Example Resource Planning:
- Front-end capacity: Limited availability
- Back-end capacity: Full team available
- Specialized skills: AI tool configuration expertise
- Cross-training opportunities: Identify during planning
```

**Sprint 28 Example:**
> "Javi, I'm worried you're going to be bored this Sprint. I don't think we have much front end work."
> Response: "Don't worry. Don't worry, I don't if I'm gonna ever finish the payroll."

### 3. AI-Assisted Tasking Session

#### 3.1 Tasking Session Setup

**Timing:** 1-2 hours after sprint planning session  
**Duration:** 60-120 minutes  
**Participants:** Development team + Business Analyst (optional)  
**Tools Required:** AI development tools, meeting transcripts, story documentation  

**Session Preparation:**
1. **Context Material Gathering**
   - Sprint planning meeting transcript
   - User story documentation
   - Technical specifications
   - Previous sprint retrospective notes

2. **AI Tool Configuration**
   - Verify model configurations are active
   - Ensure API access is functional
   - Prepare context prompts and templates
   - Test tool integrations

3. **Collaboration Setup**
   - Screen sharing for AI tool usage
   - Shared documentation access
   - Real-time collaboration tools

#### 3.2 AI-Assisted Task Breakdown Process

**Step 1: Story Context Analysis**
```
AI Prompt Template:
"Analyze the following user story and meeting context to identify:
1. Core functional requirements
2. Technical implementation components
3. Potential complexity areas
4. Integration points and dependencies
5. Testing requirements

Story: [Insert story details]
Context: [Insert meeting transcript excerpt]"
```

**Step 2: Task Generation and Refinement**
- Use AI to generate initial task breakdown
- Team review and refinement of AI suggestions
- Technical feasibility validation
- Effort estimation for each task

**Step 3: Implementation Planning**
- Task sequencing and dependencies
- Developer assignment considerations
- Risk mitigation planning
- Definition of done criteria

#### 3.3 Collaborative AI Usage

**Best Practices for Team AI Integration:**
1. **Shared Context:** Ensure all team members have access to the same context materials
2. **Iterative Refinement:** Use AI suggestions as starting points, not final answers
3. **Technical Validation:** Always validate AI suggestions against technical constraints
4. **Documentation:** Capture AI-assisted decisions and rationale

**Example Collaboration Flow:**
> "And you, oh, John, could you make sure if I'm not already that you give me access to this transcript? Does that use it to help with the transcan?"
