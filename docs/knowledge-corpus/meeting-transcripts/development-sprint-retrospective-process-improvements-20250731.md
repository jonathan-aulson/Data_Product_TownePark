# Development Sprint Retrospective Process Improvements

## Meeting Overview

**Date:** July 31, 2025  
**Duration:** 30 minutes 3 seconds  
**Meeting Type:** Sprint Retrospective  
**Participants:** Christopher Thompson, Javier Casas, Cesar Figueroa, Jonathan Aulson, Graham Olson

## Executive Summary

Critical sprint retrospective session identifying key process improvements for demo workflows, AI integration challenges, and quality assurance enhancements. The team addressed developer bias in demo processes, AI validation gaps, and established protocols for improved story ownership separation and testing procedures.

## Key Process Improvements Identified

### Demo Process Enhancement

#### Current Issues Identified

**Developer Bias Problem:**
- Person who implemented the feature also presented the demo
- Led to biased testing and missed critical issues
- Created confirmation bias in feature validation
- Resulted in features being released without fully meeting acceptance criteria

**Testing Blind Spots:**
- Developers testing their own work created systematic gaps
- Preconceived notions about implementation affected testing thoroughness
- Acceptance criteria gaps not identified until post-deployment

#### Proposed Solutions

**1. Story Ownership Separation**
- **Implementation:** Separate the person who does the work from the person who owns the story
- **Demo Responsibility:** Story owner conducts the demo, not the developer who implemented it
- **Benefit:** Provides outside perspective without preconceived notions about implementation
- **Quality Impact:** Reduces confirmation bias and improves issue detection

**2. Demo Preparation Protocol**
- **Agenda Creation:** Story owner creates demo agenda based on acceptance criteria
- **AI Assistance:** Leverage AI to generate demo flows that exercise all acceptance criteria efficiently
- **Timing:** 5-minute preparation before demo to review agenda and acceptance criteria
- **Validation:** Ensure all acceptance criteria are explicitly tested during demo

**3. Demo Timing in Workflow**
- **Preferred Approach:** Demo from feature branch before merging to develop
- **Fallback Protocol:** If issues arise where feature branch demo doesn't match develop behavior, demo from develop
- **Issue Resolution:** If demo reveals issues, move story back to active status and create bug fix tasks
- **Quality Gate:** Demo serves as final validation before code integration

#### Demo Section Addition to User Stories

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Add demo section to user stories during creation
- Content: Ordered set of steps that exercise all acceptance criteria efficiently
- Example: 10-step demo flow might exercise 25 different acceptance criteria when done in optimal order
- Integration: Demo steps become part of acceptance criteria validation

### AI Integration Challenges

#### Identified Issues

**Confirmation Bias:**
- AI tends to want to be correct and complete
- Potentially overlooks issues in favor of completion
- May provide false confidence in implementation quality

**Speed vs Quality Trade-off:**
- Moving faster with AI increases risk of overlooking details
- Rapid development can bypass thorough validation steps
- Efficiency gains may compromise thoroughness

**Complexity Factor:**
- Higher complexity features combined with AI usage increases error potential
- AI may not fully understand complex business rule interactions
- Integration points become more challenging with AI assistance

#### Proposed Mitigation Strategies

**1. Validation Prompts**
- **Implementation:** Add prompts asking AI to explain how changes impact acceptance criteria
- **Requirement:** Force AI to validate acceptance criteria achievement before completion
- **Validation Framework:** Systematic AI self-validation protocols
- **Quality Assurance:** AI must demonstrate understanding of business requirements

**2. Test Case Generation**
- **Approach:** Have AI generate comprehensive test cases for complex features
- **Validation:** Use test cases to validate inputs, outputs, and edge cases
- **Coverage:** Ensure all scenarios and configurations are tested
- **Integration:** Automated test case execution in development workflow

**3. Automated Testing Integration**
- **Current State:** AI is automatically creating tests in console for functions
- **Enhancement:** Gather more information about automated test generation capabilities
- **Implementation:** Integrate automated testing into development workflow
- **Expansion:** Extend automated testing to UI components and integration points

### Project Complexity Analysis

#### Contributing Factors to Recent Issues

**1. Increased Complexity**
- Features are more complex than initial billing system work
- Multiple system interactions and integration points
- Real-time calculation requirements vs. batch processing

**2. Integration Challenges**
- More entry points and system interactions
- Complex data flow between frontend and backend
- Multiple component dependencies within single features

**3. End-Game Pressure**
- Final project phases require tying all components together
- Integration testing becomes more critical
- System-wide impact of changes increases

**4. AI Dependency**
- Increased reliance on AI tools in development process
- Need for AI validation and quality assurance protocols
- Balance between AI efficiency and human oversight

**5. Component Overlap**
- Multiple stories affecting same components within sprints
- Increased risk of merge conflicts and integration issues
- Need for better coordination and dependency management

#### Historical Context

**Billing System Era:**
- Simpler UI with backend calculations in Power Automate
- More straightforward feature implementation
- Limited integration complexity

**Current Forecasting System:**
- Complex UI components with real-time calculations
- Multiple data sources and calculation engines
- Advanced user interaction patterns

**Evolution:**
- From "first draft" tolerance to production-ready requirements
- Increased quality expectations and user experience standards
- More sophisticated business rule implementation

## Future Project Roadmap

### Immediate Next Steps

**Team Structure Decision:**
- **Decision Point:** Grow another team vs. grow current team
- **Timeline:** Projects stacked through end of 2027
- **Capacity Planning:** Need to determine optimal team structure
- **Resource Allocation:** Balance current project completion with future capacity

### Upcoming Projects (Priority Order)

#### 1. Billing Phase 3
- **Scope:** Build Power Bill features for 10-percenters
- **Timeline:** Likely concurrent with RSS development
- **Impact:** Enable all 10-percenters to bill through Power Bill RSS
- **Technical Requirements:** Extension of current billing system architecture

#### 2. RSS Front-end Development
- **Current State:** RSS file ingestion mechanism exists
- **Enhancement:** Build front-end for online revenue and stats entry
- **Benefit:** Replace manual file submission with web interface
- **User Experience:** Streamlined data entry and validation

#### 3. Budgeting System
- **Timeline:** Early summer start for Q4 completion
- **Integration:** Work with forecasting and billing systems
- **Goal:** Complete budgeting/forecasting/billing ecosystem by 2027 budget cycle
- **Architecture:** Integrated financial planning platform

#### 4. AI Enterprise Implementation
- **Scope:** Implement Towne Park enterprise AI bot
- **Status:** Currently in sales process
- **Potential:** Significant enterprise-wide impact
- **Integration:** Leverage existing AI development expertise
