```

### **Field Definitions and Source Mappings**

| Field Name | Data Type | Source System | Source Field | Business Purpose | Validation Rules |
|------------|-----------|---------------|--------------|------------------|------------------|
| **SITE** | CHAR(4) | RSS | Site_ID | Unique site identifier for revenue attribution | Must match active site registry |
| **DATE** | DATE | RSS | Transaction_Date | Revenue transaction date for temporal analysis | Valid calendar date, not future |

## Business Logic Transformations

### **Revenue Category Derivation Logic**

The REVENUE_CATEGORY field provides business-friendly categorization of revenue codes for reporting and analysis:

```sql
-- Revenue Category Business Logic
CASE 
    WHEN REVENUE_CODE IN ('VD1', 'VD2', 'VD3') THEN 'Valet Daily'
    WHEN REVENUE_CODE IN ('VO1', 'VO2', 'VO3') THEN 'Valet Overnight'
    WHEN REVENUE_CODE IN ('VM1', 'VM2', 'VM3') THEN 'Valet Monthly'
    WHEN REVENUE_CODE IN ('SD1', 'SD2', 'SD3') THEN 'Self Daily'
    WHEN REVENUE_CODE IN ('SO1', 'SO2', 'SO3') THEN 'Self Overnight'
    WHEN REVENUE_CODE IN ('SM1', 'SM2', 'SM3') THEN 'Self Monthly'
    WHEN REVENUE_CODE IN ('VA1', 'VA2', 'VA3') THEN 'Valet Aggregator'
    WHEN REVENUE_CODE IN ('SA1', 'SA2', 'SA3') THEN 'Self Aggregator'
    ELSE 'Other'
END AS REVENUE_CATEGORY
```

**Business Rules**:
- **Valet Services**: Premium service offerings with higher revenue per transaction
- **Self-Park Services**: Standard parking services with volume-based revenue
- **Aggregator Services**: Third-party platform revenue with different margin structures
- **Tiered Codes**: 1/2/3 suffixes represent different pricing tiers or service levels

### **Value Type Classification Logic**

The VALUE_TYPE field categorizes measures for dimensional analysis and reporting:

```sql
-- Value Type Classification Logic
CASE 
    WHEN MEASURE_NAME IN ('EXTERNALREVENUE', 'NETEXTERNALREVENUE', 'BILLABLE_NET_VALIDATIONS') 
        THEN 'Revenue'
    WHEN MEASURE_NAME = 'VEHICLECOUNT' 
        THEN 'Vehicles'
    WHEN MEASURE_NAME IN ('OCCUPIED_ROOMS', 'AVAILABLE_ROOMS') 
        THEN 'Other'
    ELSE 'Unknown'
END AS VALUE_TYPE
```

**Business Applications**:
- **Revenue Measures**: Financial analysis and revenue recognition
- **Vehicle Measures**: Operational metrics and capacity utilization
- **Other Measures**: Supporting metrics for business intelligence

### **Net External Revenue Calculation**

The NETEXTERNALREVENUE field applies complex business rules for tax handling and revenue recognition:

```sql
-- Net External Revenue Calculation Logic
CASE
    WHEN DEPOSIT_FLAG = 'Y' AND TOWNEPARK_RESPONSIBLE_FOR_TAX = 'Y' THEN
        EXTERNALREVENUE - (EXTERNALREVENUE * TAX_RATE)
    WHEN DEPOSIT_FLAG = 'N' THEN
        EXTERNALREVENUE
    ELSE
        EXTERNALREVENUE
END AS NETEXTERNALREVENUE
```

**Business Rules**:
- **Towne Park Deposits (Y)**: Net revenue after tax deduction when Towne Park handles taxes
- **Client Deposits (N)**: Gross revenue when client handles tax obligations
- **Variable Deposits (V)**: Gross revenue with case-by-case tax handling

## Runtime Calculated Key Performance Indicators

### **Operational Metrics**

The data model supports real-time calculation of critical business metrics:

| KPI Name | Calculation Formula | Business Purpose | Performance Target |
|----------|-------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| **OCCUPANCY_PERCENTAGE** | `OCCUPIED_ROOMS / AVAILABLE_ROOMS * 100` | Hotel occupancy rate for demand correlation | Industry benchmark comparison |
| **REVENUE_PER_VEHICLE** | `NETEXTERNALREVENUE / NULLIF(VEHICLECOUNT, 0)` | Average revenue efficiency per transaction | Revenue optimization analysis |
| **CAPTURE_RATIO** | `(SUM Overnight VEHICLECOUNT) / NULLIF(OCCUPIED_ROOMS, 0) * 100` | Percentage of hotel guests using parking | Market penetration measurement |
| **DRIVE_IN_RATIO** | `(Total VEHICLECOUNT - Overnight VEHICLECOUNT) / NULLIF(OCCUPIED_ROOMS, 0)` | Non-guest parking utilization | Revenue diversification analysis |

### **Financial Performance Calculations**

```sql
-- Advanced KPI Calculations
SELECT 
    SITE,
    DATE,
    -- Occupancy Analysis
    CASE 
        WHEN AVAILABLE_ROOMS > 0 
        THEN CAST(OCCUPIED_ROOMS AS DECIMAL) / AVAILABLE_ROOMS * 100 
        ELSE 0 
    END AS OCCUPANCY_PERCENTAGE,
    
    -- Revenue Efficiency
    CASE 
        WHEN VEHICLECOUNT > 0 
        THEN NETEXTERNALREVENUE / VEHICLECOUNT 
        ELSE 0 
    END AS REVENUE_PER_VEHICLE,
    
    -- Market Penetration
    CASE 
        WHEN OCCUPIED_ROOMS > 0 
        THEN (
            SELECT SUM(VEHICLECOUNT) 
            FROM REVENUE_DATAMART_DAILY r2 
            WHERE r2.SITE = r1.SITE 
            AND r2.DATE = r1.DATE 
            AND r2.REVENUE_CODE IN ('VO1', 'VO2', 'VO3', 'SO1', 'SO2', 'SO3')
        ) / CAST(OCCUPIED_ROOMS AS DECIMAL) * 100
        ELSE 0 
    END AS CAPTURE_RATIO
FROM REVENUE_DATAMART_DAILY r1
```

INSERT INTO REVENUE_DATAMART_MONTHLY
SELECT 
    SITE,
    YEAR(DATE) AS YEAR,
    MONTH(DATE) AS MONTH,
    REVENUE_CODE,
    REVENUE_CATEGORY,
    SUM(NETEXTERNALREVENUE) AS MONTHLY_REVENUE,
    SUM(VEHICLECOUNT) AS MONTHLY_VEHICLES,
    AVG(OCCUPIED_ROOMS) AS AVG_OCCUPIED_ROOMS,
    AVG(AVAILABLE_ROOMS) AS AVG_AVAILABLE_ROOMS
FROM REVENUE_DATAMART_DAILY
WHERE DATE BETWEEN DATEADD(YEAR, -3, GETDATE()) AND DATEADD(YEAR, -2, GETDATE())
GROUP BY SITE, YEAR(DATE), MONTH(DATE), REVENUE_CODE, REVENUE_CATEGORY

-- Step 2: Archive to Azure Data Lake

## Data Management and Operations

### **ETL Processing Framework**

**Data Loading Strategy**:
- **Daily Processing**: Full load for previous 7 days + current day to capture corrections
- **Historical Refresh**: Monthly full reload for previous 3 months
- **Real-time Updates**: Incremental updates for critical revenue corrections

**Processing Schedule**:
```yaml
etl_schedule:
  daily_load:
    time: "06:00 UTC"
    scope: "current_day_plus_7_days"
    validation: "revenue_reconciliation"
  
  weekly_refresh:
    time: "Sunday 02:00 UTC"
    scope: "current_month_full_reload"
    validation: "comprehensive_data_quality"
  
  monthly_archive:
    time: "1st Sunday 01:00 UTC"
    scope: "historical_data_archival"
    validation: "archive_integrity_check"
```

### **Data Quality Monitoring**

```sql
-- Automated Data Quality Checks
-- Check 1: Revenue Reconciliation
CREATE PROCEDURE sp_ValidateRevenueReconciliation
AS
BEGIN
    DECLARE @VarianceThreshold DECIMAL(10,2) = 100.00
    
    SELECT 
        'Revenue Reconciliation Failure' AS CheckType,
        SITE,
        DATE,
        EDW_TOTAL,
        RSS_TOTAL,
        VARIANCE
    FROM (
        SELECT 
            r.SITE,
            r.DATE,
            SUM(r.EXTERNALREVENUE) AS EDW_TOTAL,
            s.RSS_TOTAL,
            ABS(SUM(r.EXTERNALREVENUE) - s.RSS_TOTAL) AS VARIANCE
        FROM REVENUE_DATAMART_DAILY r
        INNER JOIN (
            SELECT SITE, DATE, SUM(REVENUE) AS RSS_TOTAL
            FROM RSS_SOURCE_DATA
            GROUP BY SITE, DATE
        ) s ON r.SITE = s.SITE AND r.DATE = s.DATE
        WHERE r.DATE = CAST(GETDATE() AS DATE)
        GROUP BY r.SITE, r.DATE, s.RSS_TOTAL
    ) validation
    WHERE VARIANCE > @VarianceThreshold
END

-- Check 2: Data Completeness
CREATE PROCEDURE sp_ValidateDataCompleteness
AS
BEGIN
    SELECT 
        'Missing Data' AS CheckType,
        SITE,
        DATE,
        'No revenue data for active site' AS Issue
    FROM ACTIVE_SITES a
    LEFT JOIN REVENUE_DATAMART_DAILY r 
        ON a.SITE = r.SITE 
        AND r.DATE = CAST(GETDATE() AS DATE)
    WHERE r.SITE IS NULL
      AND a.STATUS = 'Active'
END
```

### **Backup and Disaster Recovery**

**Backup Strategy**:
- **Daily Incremental**: Transaction log backups every 15 minutes
- **Weekly Full**: Complete database backup every Sunday
- **Monthly Archive**: Long-term retention backup to Azure Storage

**Recovery Procedures**:
```sql
-- Point-in-Time Recovery Example
RESTORE DATABASE REVENUE_DATAMART_DAILY 
FROM DISK = 'C:\Backups\REVENUE_DATAMART_DAILY_FULL.bak'
WITH NORECOVERY

RESTORE LOG REVENUE_DATAMART_DAILY 
FROM DISK = 'C:\Backups\REVENUE_DATAMART_DAILY_LOG.trn'
WITH RECOVERY, STOPAT = '2025-08-08 14:30:00'
```

**Disaster Recovery Targets**:
- **Recovery Time Objective (RTO)**: 4 hours
- **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**: 15 minutes
- **Geo-Redundant Storage**: Azure paired regions
- **Automated Failover**: Azure SQL Database failover groups

## Security and Compliance Framework

### **Data Classification and Protection**

```yaml
data_classification:
  revenue_data:
    classification: "Confidential"
    encryption: "AES-256 at rest and in transit"
    access_control: "Role-based with approval workflow"
    audit_logging: "Comprehensive access and modification logs"
  
  customer_data:
    classification: "Restricted"
    encryption: "AES-256 with key rotation"
    access_control: "Need-to-know basis with dual approval"
    audit_logging: "Enhanced monitoring with real-time alerts"
  
  operational_metrics:
    classification: "Internal"
    encryption: "Standard encryption"
    access_control: "Role-based access"
    audit_logging: "Standard audit trail"
```

### **SOX Compliance Requirements**

**Financial Reporting Controls**:
- **Segregation of Duties**: ETL process requires dual approval for modifications
- **Change Management**: All schema changes require documented approval
- **Audit Trail**: Complete transaction history with immutable timestamps
- **Data Integrity**: Automated validation and reconciliation processes

**Compliance Validation**:
```sql
-- SOX Compliance Audit Query
SELECT 
    'Data Modification Audit' AS AuditType,
    TABLE_NAME,
    OPERATION_TYPE,
    USER_NAME,
    TIMESTAMP,
    AFFECTED_ROWS,
    APPROVAL_STATUS
FROM AUDIT_LOG
WHERE TABLE_NAME = 'REVENUE_DATAMART_DAILY'
  AND TIMESTAMP >= DATEADD(MONTH, -1, GETDATE())
  AND OPERATION_TYPE IN ('INSERT', 'UPDATE', 'DELETE')
ORDER BY TIMESTAMP DESC
```
