## Business Context and Requirements

### Towne Park Business Overview

Towne Park operates parking and transportation services primarily for hospitality (hotels) and healthcare (hospitals) sectors. The financial systems support diverse operational and contractual structures:

#### **Contract Structures**
The business utilizes multiple deal types with varying revenue implications:

- **Revenue Share**: External parking revenue shared with clients based on tiered percentages and thresholds
- **Management Agreement**: Towne Park manages operations, billing back expenses plus management fees
- **Per Labor Hour (PLH)**: Billing based on hours worked at contractually agreed rates
- **Fixed Fee**: Predetermined service fees with potential escalators
- **Per Occupied Room (POR)**: Revenue based on occupied rooms multiplied by contractual rates
- **Hybrid Deals**: Combinations of multiple structures

#### **Operational Complexity**
- **"10 Percenter" Sites**: Highly complex or customized contracts requiring special handling
- **Multi-level Operations**: Site, district, regional, and corporate organizational structure
- **Diverse Revenue Streams**: External revenue (parking fees) and internal revenue (management fees, billables)
- **Labor Management**: Complex staffing models with multiple job families and roles

### Pain Points Addressed

The new systems address critical operational challenges:

#### **Process Inefficiencies**
- **Cumbersome Excel Processes**: Current forecasting files described as "overwhelming" for new users
- **Manual Data Entry**: Cell-by-cell data entry prone to errors and formula corruption
- **Training Complexity**: Difficult and time-consuming training for new Account Managers
- **Multiple Sources of Truth**: Disparate systems leading to confusion and inconsistency

#### **Data and Visibility Issues**
- **Delayed Data Updates**: 24-hour delays in data availability hindering real-time decision-making
- **Inconsistent Definitions**: Lack of standardized budgeting and forecasting approaches
- **System Disconnects**: Misalignment between operational forecasts and scheduling systems
- **Limited Analytical Support**: Focus on data input rather than critical thinking and analysis

## System Architecture and Components

### High-Level Architecture

The system architecture follows a integrated approach connecting multiple data sources and user interfaces:
