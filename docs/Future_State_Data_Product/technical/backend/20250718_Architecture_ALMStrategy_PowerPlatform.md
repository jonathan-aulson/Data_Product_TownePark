# Towne Park Architecture - ALM and CI/CD Strategy for Power Platform

## Purpose

This document outlines the comprehensive Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) strategy and CI/CD implementation approach for Towne Park's Power Platform solutions and Azure Static Web Apps. It addresses current state challenges and provides a roadmap for implementing proper environment isolation, deployment pipelines, and development workflows.

## Current State Analysis

### Existing CI/CD Limitations

**Critical Issue Identified (February 19, 2025):**
- Two Azure pipelines currently exist:
  1. Development pipeline: Deploys React frontend + API backend to development SWA environment
  2. Production pipeline: Deploys to BOTH release and production environments from master branch

**Key Problems:**
- No ability to deploy release candidates to pre-production environments (TEST, STAGE)
- Production deployment triggered immediately upon master branch merge
- All development, QA, and UAT testing must occur in development environment
- No proper environment isolation for testing phases

### Power Platform Flow Limitations

**Process License Constraints (February 20, 2025):**
- Maximum 25 cloud flows per process-flow with process license
- Current count: 24 flows associated with Statement Generation process
- Additional flows needed for Forecasting system
- Likely need separate Process License for Forecasting business process

## Proposed ALM Strategy

### Environment Architecture

#### Target Environment Structure

```mermaid
graph TB
    A[Development Environments] --> B[QA Sandbox]
    B --> C[UAT Environment]
    C --> D[Production Environment]
    
    A1[Individual Dev Env] --> A
    A2[Shared Dev Env] --> A
    A3[Isolated Dev Env] --> A
```

**Environment Tiers:**
1. **Development Tier**
   - Individual developer environments (isolated)
   - Shared development environment
   - Daily pristine environment instantiation via build pipeline
   
2. **QA Tier**
   - QA Sandbox environment
   - Automated testing environment
   - Manual testing environment
   
3. **Pre-Production Tier**
   - UAT environment
   - Training environment
   - Performance testing environment
   
4. **Production Tier**
   - Live production environment
   - Disaster recovery environment

### Branching Strategy

**Recommended Git Flow:**
- **Feature Branches**: Individual development work
- **Development Branch**: Integration of feature work
- **Release Branch**: Preparation for production deployment
- **Master Branch**: Production-ready code only

**Key Principles:**
- No direct commits to master branch
- All changes flow through pull requests
- Automated testing at each integration point
- Environment-specific configuration management

### Deployment Pipeline Strategy

#### Option 1: Power Platform Pipelines (Recommended)
- Native Power Platform ALM capabilities
- Integrated with Power Platform environments
- Built-in solution management
- Automated dependency tracking

#### Option 2: Azure DevOps Pipelines
- Greater flexibility and customization
- Integration with existing Azure infrastructure
- Advanced testing and validation capabilities
- Custom deployment logic

### Configuration Migration Strategy

**Configuration Migration Tool Implementation:**
- Capture configuration and test data from source environments
- Source control integration for configuration data
- Automated transport between environments
- Test data automation for validation

**Key Capabilities:**
- Test data capturing and versioning
- Environment-specific configuration management
- Automated testing data deployment
- Configuration drift detection

## Implementation Roadmap

   - Shared development environment for integration
   - Automated environment provisioning

2. **Data Management Strategy**
   - Import production data into development environments
   - Import Power Automate objects and configurations
   - Establish data refresh procedures

### Phase 3: Pipeline Automation
1. **Automated Deployment Pipelines**
   - Development to QA automation
   - QA to UAT automation
   - UAT to Production with approval gates

2. **Testing Integration**
   - Automated unit testing
   - Integration testing frameworks
   - Performance testing automation

### Phase 4: Advanced ALM Features
1. **Configuration Management**
   - Automated configuration drift detection
   - Environment-specific configuration deployment
   - Configuration versioning and rollback

2. **Monitoring and Observability**
   - Deployment success monitoring
   - Environment health checks
   - Performance monitoring integration

## Technical Specifications

### Environment Configuration Requirements

**Development Environments:**
