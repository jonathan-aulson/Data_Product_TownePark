# External Code Repository Links - Reference Documentation

## Purpose

This document maintains external code repository links for validation purposes but are not included in active documentation to maintain zero-warning mkdocs builds. These links reference external code repositories that provide essential validation value for documented business rules and technical specifications.

## External Link Categories

### Power Platform Solution References
**Purpose**: These links reference Power Platform solution components for validation of documented business rules and technical specifications.

#### Revenue Share Calculation Validation
- `../../../Towne-Park-Billing-PA-Solution/BillingSystem/Formulas/bs_revenuesharebypercent-FormulaDefinitions.yaml` - Revenue share calculation validation
- **Validation Purpose**: Validates revenue share percentage calculation business rules
- **Referenced In**: Forecasting Technical Spec - Sprint 26 Features
- **Validation Context**: Essential for verifying documented revenue share calculation formulas

#### Workflow Process Validation
- `../../../Towne-Park-Billing-PA-Solution/BillingSystem/Workflows/RevenueSharing20250325-1B21C7C0-E609-F011-BAE3-000D3A5AC294.json` - Revenue sharing workflow validation
- **Validation Purpose**: Validates revenue sharing workflow processes
- **Referenced In**: Forecasting Technical Spec - Sprint 26 Features
- **Validation Context**: Essential for verifying documented workflow steps and business logic

#### Per Occupied Room Generation Validation
- `../../../Towne-Park-Billing-PA-Solution/BillingSystem/Workflows/PerOccupiedRoomGenerationChildFlow20250224-E88DE41D-BAF2-EF11-BE21-6045BD096814.json` - Per occupied room calculation workflow
- **Validation Purpose**: Validates per occupied room billing calculation processes
- **Referenced In**: Forecasting Technical Spec - Sprint 26 Features
- **Validation Context**: Essential for verifying per occupied room billing logic implementation

### Source Code Repository References
**Purpose**: These links reference source code repositories for validation of development standards and code quality guidelines.

#### Code Quality and Review Guidelines
- `../../../Towne-Park-Billing-Source-Code/Towne Park Billing/.clinerules/` - Code quality and review guidelines directory
- **Validation Purpose**: Validates documented code quality standards and review processes
- **Referenced In**: AI Validation Report - SDLC Integration
- **Validation Context**: Essential for verifying code quality standards implementation

#### Pull Request Review Guidelines
- `../../../Towne-Park-Billing-Source-Code/Towne Park Billing/.clinerules/pull-request-review-guidelines.md` - Pull request review process documentation
- **Validation Purpose**: Validates documented pull request review procedures
- **Referenced In**: AI Validation Report - SDLC Integration
- **Validation Context**: Essential for verifying development workflow standards

### Azure Components References
**Purpose**: These links reference Azure infrastructure components for validation of deployment and infrastructure documentation.

#### Infrastructure Configuration Validation
- `../../../Towne-Park-Azure-Components/` - Azure infrastructure components
- **Validation Purpose**: Validates documented infrastructure configuration and deployment procedures
- **Referenced In**: Various technical specifications
- **Validation Context**: Essential for verifying infrastructure implementation details

## External Link Evaluation Criteria

### Essential for Code Validation
These links provide critical validation of documented business rules or technical specifications:
- Revenue share calculation formulas require validation against actual Power Platform implementation
- Workflow processes need verification against implemented Power Apps workflows
- Code quality standards must be validated against actual development guidelines

### Implementation Reference
These links point to actual implementation that validates documented processes:
- Power Platform formulas validate business rule calculations
- Workflow JSON files validate documented process flows
- Code quality guidelines validate documented development standards

### Technical Accuracy
These links are necessary to verify technical accuracy of documentation:
- Formula definitions ensure calculation accuracy
- Workflow definitions ensure process accuracy
- Code guidelines ensure development standard accuracy

### No Internal Alternative
No equivalent internal documentation exists or can be created for these validation purposes:
- Power Platform solution files are external to documentation system
- Source code repositories are separate from documentation
- Azure components are managed in separate repositories

## External Link Resolution Actions

### KEEP - Essential Validation Value
The following external links provide essential validation value and should be preserved for reference:
- All Power Platform solution formula and workflow references
- Source code repository references for code quality validation
- Azure component references for infrastructure validation

### DOCUMENT - Reference Only
These links are documented here for reference purposes but removed from active documentation:
- All links listed in this document serve as reference for validation activities
- Links are maintained for future validation needs
- Documentation team can reference these links for code validation activities

### REPLACE - Internal Documentation References
Where possible, external links have been replaced with internal documentation references:
- Business rules documentation replaces direct formula references
- Technical specifications replace direct workflow references
- Configuration guides replace direct infrastructure references

### REMOVE - No Essential Value
No external links have been identified for removal as all documented links provide essential validation value.

## Usage Guidelines

### For Documentation Team
- Use these links for code validation activities
- Reference these links when updating business rules or technical specifications
- Validate documented processes against actual implementation using these links
- Do not include these links directly in active documentation to maintain zero-warning builds

### For Development Team
- These links provide validation context for documented standards
- Use these references to ensure documentation accuracy
- Update this document when external repository structures change
- Coordinate with documentation team when validation needs change

### For Quality Assurance
- These links support validation of documented processes
- Use for verification of business rule implementation
- Reference for technical specification accuracy validation
- Support compliance and audit activities with implementation verification

## Maintenance Procedures

### Regular Review
- Quarterly review of external link validity and accessibility
- Annual review of validation requirements and link necessity
- Update links when external repository structures change
- Remove links that no longer provide validation value

### Change Management
- Document changes to external repository structures
- Update validation procedures when links change
- Coordinate with external repository owners for major changes
- Maintain historical record of link changes for audit purposes

### Validation Activities
- Use these links for periodic validation of documented processes
- Verify business rule accuracy against implementation
- Validate technical specification completeness
- Support code review and quality assurance activities
