## Detailed Implementation Strategy

### Recommended Hybrid Approach

**Primary Strategy**: Combine Power Automate and Azure Functions based on use case
- **Simple Data Access**: Continue using Power Automate + Data Gateway
- **Complex Logic**: Implement Azure Function + Hybrid Connection
- **High-Volume Processing**: Azure Function with optimized connectivity

### Azure Function + Hybrid Connection Implementation

#### Technical Specifications

**Azure Function Configuration:**
- **Hosting Plan**: App Service Plan (required for Hybrid Connections)
- **Runtime**: .NET 6+ or Node.js 18+
- **Authentication**: Azure AD integration with service principal
- **Monitoring**: Application Insights integration

**Hybrid Connection Setup:**
```yaml
Hybrid Connection Configuration:
  Name: "TownePark-SQL-Connection"
  Endpoint: "sql-server.townepark.local:1433"
  Authentication: "Windows Authentication"
  Encryption: "TLS 1.2"
  Connection Pooling: "Enabled"
```

**On-Premise Requirements:**
- Hybrid Connection Manager installation
- Service account for database access
- Network connectivity validation
- Security policy compliance

#### Security Implementation

**Authentication and Authorization:**
- Azure AD service principal for Function authentication
- SQL Server integrated authentication for database access
- Role-based access control (RBAC) implementation
- API key management for external access

**Data Protection:**
- TLS 1.2 encryption for all connections
- Data masking for sensitive information
- Audit logging for all data access
- Compliance with data protection regulations

**Network Security:**
- Private endpoint configuration where applicable
- Network security group (NSG) rules
- Firewall rules for Hybrid Connection Manager
- Regular security assessments

### Data Integration Patterns

#### Real-Time Data Access Pattern
```csharp
// Example Azure Function implementation
[FunctionName("GetCustomerData")]
public static async Task<IActionResult> GetCustomerData(
    [HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Function, "get")] HttpRequest req,
    ILogger log)
{
    // Validate authentication
    var principal = await ValidateTokenAsync(req);
    
    // Execute database query via Hybrid Connection
    var connectionString = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("OnPremiseDB");
    using var connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString);
    
    // Implement query logic
    var result = await ExecuteQueryAsync(connection, req.Query["customerId"]);
    
    return new OkObjectResult(result);
}
```

#### Batch Data Synchronization Pattern
- Scheduled Azure Functions for periodic data sync
- Change data capture (CDC) for incremental updates
- Error handling and retry mechanisms
- Data validation and transformation logic

#### Event-Driven Integration Pattern
- Service Bus integration for asynchronous processing
- Event Grid for real-time notifications
- Dead letter queues for error handling
- Monitoring and alerting for failed events

## Environment Strategy

### Multi-Environment Architecture

**Development Environment:**
- Separate Hybrid Connections per environment
- Development database connections
- Isolated testing capabilities
- Development-specific configuration

**QA/UAT Environment:**
- Shared QA database connections
- Multi-tenant storage strategy with environment prefixes
- Example: `/qa/{site_id}/reports/{filename}`
- Isolated data to prevent cross-environment contamination

**Production Environment:**
- Dedicated production Hybrid Connections
- High availability configuration
- Disaster recovery capabilities
- Performance monitoring and optimization

### Data Isolation Strategy

**Multi-Tenant Approach:**
```
Storage Path Structure:
- /dev/{site_id}/reports/{filename}
- /qa/{site_id}/reports/{filename}
- /uat/{site_id}/reports/{filename}
- /prod/{site_id}/reports/{filename}
```

**Benefits:**
- Prevents accidental data overwrites between environments
- Maintains data integrity across environments
- Simplifies administration and maintenance
- Enables environment-specific data management

## Performance Considerations

### Connection Optimization
- Connection pooling for database connections
- Caching strategies for frequently accessed data
- Asynchronous processing for long-running operations
- Load balancing for high-availability scenarios

### Scalability Planning
- Auto-scaling configuration for Azure Functions
- Database connection limits and management
- Monitoring and alerting for performance thresholds
- Capacity planning for growth scenarios

### Monitoring and Observability
- Application Insights for Azure Functions
- Custom metrics for business operations
- Performance counters for database connections
- End-to-end transaction tracing

## Data Replication and Backup Strategy
