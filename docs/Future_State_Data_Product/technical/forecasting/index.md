```
/api/v1/forecasting/
â”œâ”€â”€ /statistics/{siteId}/{period}
â”œâ”€â”€ /payroll/{siteId}/{period}
â”œâ”€â”€ /rates/{siteId}/{period}
â”œâ”€â”€ /revenue/{siteId}/{period}
â””â”€â”€ /pl-view/{siteId}/{period}
```

**Authentication:**
- OAuth 2.0 with JWT tokens
- Role-based access control
- Site-level data access restrictions

### Data Model Architecture
