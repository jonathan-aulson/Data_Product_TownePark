# Forecasting UI/UX Design Standards

## Document Overview

This document establishes UI/UX design standards for the Towne Park Forecasting system, derived from backlog grooming decisions made on May 30, 2025. These standards ensure consistent user experience, optimal usability for account managers, and effective data visualization across the forecasting platform.

## Executive Summary

The forecasting system UI/UX design prioritizes account manager productivity through intuitive interfaces, clear data visualization, and responsive design patterns. Key design decisions focus on statistics display, calendar interactions, variance indicators, and summary card layouts that enhance decision-making capabilities.

## Design Principles and Standards

### 1. User-Centered Design Philosophy

#### 1.1 Account Manager Focus

**Primary User:** Account Managers  
**Design Priority:** Productivity and ease of use  
**Feedback Integration:** Direct user feedback drives design decisions  

**Core Design Principles:**
- **Clarity:** Information presented clearly without cognitive overload
- **Efficiency:** Quick access to critical data and functions
- **Consistency:** Uniform design patterns across all forecasting modules
- **Accessibility:** Designs accommodate various user capabilities and preferences

**User Feedback Integration Process:**
```
Feedback Collection → Design Iteration → User Validation → Implementation
```

**Example from Design Session:**
> "The feedback from the account managers was that it helps kind of being able to quickly see a weekend and pick it. So that's that, might that might stick."

#### 1.2 Data-Driven Design Decisions

**Decision Framework:**
1. **User Research:** Direct feedback from account managers
2. **Usability Testing:** Prototype validation with real users
3. **Performance Metrics:** Task completion time and accuracy
4. **Business Impact:** Effect on forecasting accuracy and efficiency

### 2. Statistics Tab Design Standards

#### 2.1 Summary Cards Implementation

**Design Specification:**
- **Layout:** Card-based interface for statistical summaries
- **Content:** Key metrics with visual hierarchy
- **Interaction:** Hover states and click actions for detailed views
- **Responsive:** Adaptive layout for different screen sizes

**Card Design Elements:**
```
Summary Card Structure:
├── Header: Metric name and time period
├── Primary Value: Large, prominent number display
├── Variance Indicator: Visual comparison element
├── Secondary Info: Supporting context and details
└── Action Area: Links to detailed views or actions
```

**Visual Hierarchy:**
1. **Primary Metrics:** Largest font size, high contrast
2. **Variance Indicators:** Color-coded, immediately visible
3. **Supporting Data:** Smaller font, contextual information
4. **Navigation Elements:** Clear but not competing with data

#### 2.2 Calendar Picker Design

**Design Requirements:**
- **Weekend Visibility:** Clear visual distinction for weekends
- **Quick Selection:** Efficient date picking for account managers
- **Context Awareness:** Show relevant date ranges and periods
- **Accessibility:** Keyboard navigation and screen reader support

**Implementation Specifications:**
```
Calendar Picker Features:
├── Weekend Highlighting: Visual emphasis on Saturday/Sunday
├── Date Range Selection: Start and end date picking
├── Quick Presets: Common periods (week, month, quarter)
├── Current Period Indicator: Clear marking of today/current period
└── Validation: Prevent invalid date selections
```

**User Experience Flow:**
1. **Default View:** Current period highlighted
2. **Selection Mode:** Click to activate date picker
3. **Weekend Emphasis:** Visual cues for weekend identification
4. **Confirmation:** Clear indication of selected period
5. **Data Update:** Immediate refresh of statistics display

**Design Rationale:**
Based on account manager feedback emphasizing the importance of weekend visibility for operational planning and data analysis.

### 3. Variance Indicator Design

#### 3.1 Visual Symbol Standards

**Approved Symbols:** Arrow indicators (replacing pyramid symbols)  
**Design Decision Date:** May 30, 2025  
**Rationale:** Improved clarity and universal recognition  

**Arrow Indicator Specifications:**
```
Variance Indicators:
├── Up Arrow (↑): Above comparison value
│   ├── Color: Green (#28a745)
│   ├── Size: 16px standard, 20px large
│   └── Position: Adjacent to numeric value
├── Down Arrow (↓): Below comparison value
│   ├── Color: Red (#dc3545)
│   ├── Size: 16px standard, 20px large
│   └── Position: Adjacent to numeric value
└── Neutral (—): Equal to comparison value
    ├── Color: Gray (#6c757d)
    ├── Size: 16px standard, 20px large
    └── Position: Adjacent to numeric value
```

**Implementation Guidelines:**
- **Consistency:** Use same arrow style across all variance displays
- **Color Accessibility:** Ensure sufficient contrast ratios
- **Size Scaling:** Proportional sizing based on context
- **Animation:** Subtle transitions when values change

#### 3.2 Actuals Number Formatting

**Display Format Standards:**
- **Number Format:** Consistent decimal places and thousand separators
- **Currency Display:** Appropriate currency symbols and formatting
- **Percentage Values:** Clear percentage indicators with precision
- **Large Numbers:** Abbreviated formats (K, M, B) for readability

**Formatting Specifications:**
```
Number Display Standards:
├── Currency: $1,234.56 (two decimal places)
├── Percentages: 12.3% (one decimal place)
├── Large Numbers: 1.2M, 3.4K (abbreviated with one decimal)
├── Variance: +5.2% or -3.1% (signed percentages)
└── Counts: 1,234 (whole numbers with separators)
```

**Variance Display Integration:**
- **Numeric Value:** Primary display with appropriate formatting
- **Variance Indicator:** Arrow symbol adjacent to number
- **Percentage Change:** Secondary display showing magnitude of variance
- **Contextual Information:** Comparison period and baseline clearly indicated

### 4. Responsive Design Standards

#### 4.1 Breakpoint Specifications

**Device Categories:**
- **Desktop:** 1200px and above (primary design target)
- **Tablet:** 768px to 1199px (adapted layouts)
- **Mobile:** Below 768px (simplified interfaces)

**Layout Adaptations:**
```
Responsive Behavior:
├── Desktop: Full card grid with all details visible
├── Tablet: Reduced card grid with condensed information
├── Mobile: Single column stack with essential data only
└── Print: Optimized layout for report generation
```

#### 4.2 Touch Interface Considerations

**Touch Targets:**
- **Minimum Size:** 44px x 44px for all interactive elements
- **Spacing:** 8px minimum between touch targets
- **Feedback:** Visual and haptic feedback for interactions
- **Gestures:** Support for common touch gestures (swipe, pinch)
