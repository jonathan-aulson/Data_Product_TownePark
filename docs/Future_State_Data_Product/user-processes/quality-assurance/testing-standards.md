# Testing Standards

## Purpose

This document establishes comprehensive testing standards and procedures for Towne Park's financial systems, ensuring consistent quality assurance practices, thorough validation, and reliable software delivery.

## Testing Framework

### Testing Philosophy
- **Quality First**: Quality is everyone's responsibility, not just QA
- **Shift Left**: Testing begins early in the development lifecycle
- **Automation Focus**: Automate repetitive and regression testing
- **Risk-Based**: Prioritize testing based on risk and business impact
- **Continuous Improvement**: Regularly evaluate and improve testing practices

### Testing Pyramid
```
    /\
   /  \    E2E Tests (10%)
  /____\   
 /      \   Integration Tests (20%)
/________\  Unit Tests (70%)
```

#### Unit Testing (70%)
- **Scope**: Individual components and functions
- **Responsibility**: Developers
- **Automation**: 100% automated
- **Coverage Target**: 80% minimum code coverage

#### Integration Testing (20%)
- **Scope**: Component interactions and API testing
- **Responsibility**: Developers and QA Engineers
- **Automation**: 90% automated
- **Coverage Target**: All integration points tested

#### End-to-End Testing (10%)
- **Scope**: Complete user workflows and business scenarios
- **Responsibility**: QA Engineers and Business Analysts
- **Automation**: 70% automated
- **Coverage Target**: Critical business paths covered

## Testing Types and Standards

### Functional Testing

#### Unit Testing Standards
```javascript
// Example Unit Test Structure
describe('Revenue Calculation Service', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    // Setup test data and mocks
  });

  it('should calculate revenue share correctly', () => {
    // Arrange
    const contractData = { /* test data */ };
    
    // Act
    const result = calculateRevenueShare(contractData);
    
    // Assert
    expect(result.amount).toBe(expectedAmount);
    expect(result.percentage).toBe(expectedPercentage);
  });

  it('should handle edge cases gracefully', () => {
    // Test edge cases and error conditions
  });
});
```

#### Integration Testing Standards
- **API Testing**: Validate all API endpoints and responses
- **Database Testing**: Verify data persistence and retrieval
- **Service Integration**: Test interactions between microservices
- **External System Integration**: Validate third-party integrations

#### System Testing Standards
