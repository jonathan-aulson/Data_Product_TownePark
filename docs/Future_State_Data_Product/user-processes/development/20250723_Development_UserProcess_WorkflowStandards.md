# Towne Park Development - Workflow and Deployment Standards

## Process Overview

This document establishes comprehensive workflow and deployment standards for Towne Park's financial systems development team. These standards ensure consistent documentation, efficient deployment processes, and clear communication of changes requiring special attention during deployment. The processes are designed to streamline development workflows while maintaining high quality and deployment safety standards.

## Prerequisites

### Required Access and Permissions
- **Repository Access**: Read/write access to relevant Azure DevOps repositories
- **Pull Request Permissions**: Ability to create, review, and approve pull requests
- **Deployment Environment Access**: Access to development, UAT, and production environments as appropriate for role
- **Documentation Tools**: Access to project documentation systems and templates

### Required Knowledge
- **Git Workflow**: Understanding of branching, merging, and pull request processes
- **Deployment Procedures**: Familiarity with environment-specific deployment requirements
- **Documentation Standards**: Knowledge of project documentation templates and requirements
- **Change Management**: Understanding of change impact assessment and communication

### Required Tools
- **Development Environment**: Configured development environment with necessary tools
- **Version Control**: Git client and Azure DevOps access
- **Documentation Tools**: Markdown editors and documentation review tools
- **Communication Tools**: Access to team communication channels for coordination

## Process Steps

### Pull Request Documentation Process

#### Step 1: Change Impact Assessment
**User Action**: Analyze changes made in the development branch to identify deployment-sensitive modifications
**System Response**: N/A (Manual assessment process)
**Decision Points**: 
- Does the change affect stored procedures?
- Does the change modify PDF container configurations?
- Does the change impact API endpoints or contracts?
- Does the change require database schema modifications?
- Does the change affect integration points with external systems?

**Validation**: Review all modified files and assess potential deployment impact
**Error Handling**: If uncertain about impact, consult with technical lead or senior developer
**Business Context**: Proper impact assessment ensures deployment teams have necessary information to safely deploy changes

#### Step 2: Tag Assignment and Documentation
**User Action**: Add appropriate tags to pull request based on change impact assessment
**System Response**: Pull request system accepts tags and makes them searchable
**Decision Points**:
- **Stored Procedure Changes**: Add tag `#stored-procedure-update`
- **PDF Container Changes**: Add tag `#pdf-container-change`
- **API Changes**: Add tag `#api-modification`
- **Database Changes**: Add tag `#database-change`
- **Integration Changes**: Add tag `#integration-update`

**Validation**: Ensure all relevant tags are applied and properly formatted
**Error Handling**: If tag format is incorrect, update according to established standards
**Business Context**: Tags enable deployment teams to quickly identify and prioritize changes requiring special attention

#### Step 3: Change Description Documentation
**User Action**: Document specific changes in pull request description with focus on deployment requirements
**System Response**: Pull request description is saved and made available to reviewers and deployment teams
**Decision Points**:
- Include deployment scripts for stored procedure changes
- Document configuration changes for PDF container modifications
- Specify API contract changes and backward compatibility considerations
- Detail database migration requirements and rollback procedures

**Validation**: Review description for completeness and clarity
**Error Handling**: If description is incomplete, add missing information before requesting review
**Business Context**: Detailed descriptions enable informed review and safe deployment execution

#### Step 4: Review and Approval Process
**User Action**: Request review from appropriate team members based on change type
**System Response**: Review requests are sent to designated reviewers
**Decision Points**:
- **Technical Changes**: Require technical lead review
- **Database Changes**: Require database administrator review
- **API Changes**: Require architecture review
- **Integration Changes**: Require integration specialist review

**Validation**: Ensure appropriate reviewers are assigned based on change type
**Error Handling**: If wrong reviewers are assigned, update reviewer list accordingly
**Business Context**: Proper review ensures changes meet quality standards and deployment safety requirements

### Deployment Query and Tracking Process

#### Step 5: Deployment Change Identification
**User Action**: Deployment team creates queries to identify changes requiring special attention
**System Response**: Query results show all pull requests with specific tags within deployment timeframe
**Decision Points**:
- Query for specific tag types (e.g., all `#stored-procedure-update` tags)
- Filter by date range for deployment window
- Group changes by deployment priority and complexity

**Validation**: Verify query results include all relevant changes for deployment window
**Error Handling**: If changes are missing from query results, verify tag application and query parameters
**Business Context**: Systematic change identification ensures no deployment-sensitive changes are overlooked

#### Step 6: Deployment Planning and Execution
**User Action**: Plan deployment sequence based on change types and dependencies
**System Response**: Deployment tools execute changes according to planned sequence
**Decision Points**:
- **Database Changes First**: Execute database changes before application changes
- **API Changes**: Coordinate API changes with dependent system updates
- **Integration Changes**: Sequence integration changes to minimize system downtime

**Validation**: Verify each deployment step completes successfully before proceeding
**Error Handling**: If deployment step fails, execute rollback procedures and investigate issue
**Business Context**: Proper sequencing and validation ensures safe and successful deployments

### Application Feature Development Process

#### Step 7: Feature Development Standards
**User Action**: Implement new features following established development patterns
**System Response**: Application incorporates new features with proper integration
**Decision Points**:
- **Save Functionality**: Implement tab-specific save operations for modified content only
- **User Feedback**: Provide clear feedback messages indicating which tabs were saved
- **State Management**: Reset "dirty" state on tabs after successful save operations

**Validation**: Test feature functionality in development environment before pull request
**Error Handling**: If feature tests fail, debug and resolve issues before requesting review
**Business Context**: Consistent feature implementation ensures predictable user experience and maintainable code

#### Step 8: Environment-Specific Configuration
**User Action**: Configure environment-specific settings for features
**System Response**: Application adapts behavior based on environment configuration
**Decision Points**:
- **Development Environment**: Enable debug features and verbose logging
- **UAT Environment**: Enable testing features and moderate logging
- **Production Environment**: Disable debug features and enable production logging

**Validation**: Verify environment-specific configurations are properly applied
**Error Handling**: If configuration is incorrect, update configuration files and redeploy
**Business Context**: Environment-specific configuration ensures appropriate behavior across different deployment stages

## Alternative Flows

4. **System Validation**: Verify system stability after rollback
5. **Issue Analysis**: Analyze root cause of deployment issues
6. **Process Improvement**: Update deployment procedures to prevent similar issues

### Large-Scale Change Management
**Trigger Condition**: Changes affecting multiple systems or requiring coordinated deployment
**Alternative Steps**:
1. **Cross-Team Coordination**: Coordinate with multiple development teams
2. **Dependency Mapping**: Map dependencies between different system changes
3. **Phased Deployment**: Plan phased deployment to minimize risk
4. **Integration Testing**: Perform comprehensive integration testing
5. **Stakeholder Communication**: Provide detailed communication to all affected stakeholders
