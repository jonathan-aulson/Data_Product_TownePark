## Parking Metrics Forecasting Process

### Information Sources for Daily Number Determination

#### Hotel Sales Team Collaboration
**Process Overview:**
- **Regular Meetings**: Schedule consistent meetings with hotel sales team to gather upcoming business information
- **Site Visits**: Visit sales office to discuss "what's on the docket for the month"
- **Business Intelligence**: Ask about new business, recurring business, and any changes from typical patterns
- **Quality Assessment**: Recognize that sales team quality varies by hotel and adapt approach accordingly

**Key Questions for Sales Team:**
- What new business bookings are confirmed for the upcoming period?
- Are there any recurring groups or events scheduled?
- What changes from typical patterns should we expect?
- Are there any last-minute bookings or cancellations anticipated?

#### Prior Year Data Analysis
**Historical Data Utilization:**
- **Baseline Establishment**: Use last year's historical data as forecasting foundation
- **Comparative Analysis**: Compare current forecasting period to similar periods in prior year
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify recurring events or groups with historical precedent
- **Average Calculations**: Calculate averages from last year for similar time periods

**Example Analysis Approach:**
> "We just had a busy weekend at my site, but as you can see last year I had the same exact group in and we did very similar numbers"

#### Hotel Booking Data Integration
**Advance Booking Process:**
- **Timeline**: Obtain advance booking information for at least the first two weeks of upcoming month
- **Forecast Timing**: Create forecast approximately two weeks before month is "locked in"
- **Starting Point**: Use advance booking data as foundation for beginning of month projections
- **Accuracy Window**: Focus on detailed accuracy for near-term bookings

#### Site Knowledge and Experience Application
**Operational Intelligence:**
- **Site Flow Understanding**: Develop deep understanding of site "flow" patterns (achievable after 6-8 months)
- **Weekly Patterns**: Know which days are typically slower (e.g., Mondays or Sundays)
- **Driving Percentages**: Understand how driving percentages fluctuate throughout the week
- **Seasonal Variations**: Account for seasonal patterns and their impact on operations

#### Special Events Awareness
**Event Impact Assessment:**
- **Property Events**: Account for big events happening at or near the property
- **Seasonal Adjustments**: Make specific adjustments for seasonal events
- **Volume Calculations**: Estimate car volumes based on event attendance

**Example Calculation:**
> "This is prom season, so... if you have these thousand people Proms, you're probably gonna get 150-200 cars on those days"

### Specific Forecasting Process Steps

#### Site Condition Assessment
**Pre-Forecasting Evaluation:**
- **Physical Challenges**: Identify issues that might affect parking metrics (renovations, construction, lobby work)
- **Operational Impacts**: Factor in challenges when projecting numbers
- **Mitigation Strategies**: Plan for reduced capacity or altered operations during disruptions

#### Occupancy-Based Forecasting
**Foundation Methodology:**
1. **Start with Occupancy**: Begin with forecasting occupied rooms or occupancy percentage
2. **Foundation Building**: Use occupancy as foundation for subsequent parking metrics
3. **Correlation Analysis**: Understand relationship between occupancy and parking demand

#### Drive-In Percentage Calculation
**Property Type Considerations:**
- **Full Valet Properties**: Different drive-in percentages than mixed-service properties
- **Self-Park Options**: Account for properties with both valet and self-park options

**Process Quote:**
> "Usually what I'll do after those things are done is I come back and I say OK, how close or how far am I from budget"

#### Variance Analysis
**Accuracy Assessment:**
- **Reasonable Variance**: If forecast is above budget and looks reasonable (e.g., "maybe I'm 1000 above budget"), consider accurate
- **Below Budget Analysis**: If forecast is below budget, ensure reason is already known
- **Proactive Explanation**: Identify variance reasons during forecast building process

#### Justification of Variances
**Documentation Requirements:**
- **Variance Explanation**: Prepare explanations for significant budget variances
- **Supporting Evidence**: Document reasons for material differences from budget
- **Proactive Analysis**: Identify variance causes during forecasting process

**Example Scenario:**
> "If I'm finding out all the information that's going on in that month and then I look and then I'm... supposed to in May be at 26, but I'm forecasting 16, then I should already know why it's that much lower"

#### Team Review Process
**Knowledge Transfer:**

## Staffing and Scheduling Patterns

### GSC (Guest Service Captain) Staffing

#### Fixed Staffing Model
**Standard Staffing Pattern:**
- **Consistent Scheduling**: Typically schedule consistent number of GSCs
- **Standard Pattern**: "For GSC, you've got 15 down the column... you Schedule 2 GSCs every day"
- **Industry Standard**: "Pretty much every other site will run one in the morning, 1 at night"
- **Site Variations**: Only slower sites deviate from two-GSC daily standard

#### GSA (Guest Service Associate) Staffing

#### Flexible Staffing Model
**Variable Staffing Approach:**
- **Flex Component**: "it's the GSAs that flex" based on business volume
- **Volume-Based Scaling**: For busy periods, significantly increase GSA staffing
- **Operational Example**: "For Friday, I knew that I was gonna need... eight or nine GSAs"
- **Constant GSC**: GSAs adjust while GSC count remains constant

### Contract Type Impact on Staffing

#### Revenue Share Restrictions
**Staffing Limitations:**
- **GSC Limitation**: "At Rev shares, we don't want more than one GSC scheduled at a time"
- **Recent Focus**: "something that they're really into lately"
- **Cost Control**: Restriction appears to be for cost control in revenue share situations

#### Scheduling Workarounds
**Creative Solutions:**
- **Coding Strategy**: "I have 3 GSCs and I'll schedule all of them, but their job code for two of them will have to be a GSA"
- **Compensation Methods**: "How I make that up to them can be different ways. Maybe I just get them lunch that day... Or maybe I add a gratuity"
- **Operational Flexibility**: Maintain operational needs while meeting contract requirements

### Site Complexity Considerations

#### Multiple Properties Impact
**Complex Site Management:**
- **Multi-Property Sites**: "I have 3 hotels at my site, so sometimes it can be pretty busy for just having one GSC"
- **Team Leads**: Use experienced staff between GSC and regular GSA for additional support
- **Experience Leverage**: "Having someone there that has experience"

#### Experience-Based Adjustments
**Staffing Optimization:**
- **Team Lead Utilization**: Use experienced team leads for additional operational support
- **Site-Specific Solutions**: Adapt staffing based on individual site complexity
- **Best Practice Sharing**: JW Marriott has similar setup due to revenue share structure with experienced staff

### Budget Performance Analysis

#### Consistent Over-Budget Performance
**Performance Patterns:**
- **2024 Actuals**: "2024 actuals are pretty consistently higher" for GSCs
- **Planning Gap**: Pattern suggests planning for 15 hours but consistently using more
- **Forecasting Adjustment**: Indicates need for more realistic forecasting for GSC hours

#### Recommended Forecasting Approach
**Position-Specific Scaling:**
- **Separate Scales**: "I think it's good to have maybe a scale separately for GSA and GSC"
- **Contract Dependency**: "really dependent on the contract that we have at the sites"
- **Differentiated Approach**: Different forecasting approaches for different position types

### Regional Variations

#### Houston-Specific Practices
**Regional Adaptations:**
- **Houston Market**: "Well, in Houston anyway. We'll schedule GS like I have 3 GSCs..."
- **Regional Variations**: Indicates forecasting practices may vary by region or market
- **Local Optimization**: Adapt practices to local market conditions and requirements
