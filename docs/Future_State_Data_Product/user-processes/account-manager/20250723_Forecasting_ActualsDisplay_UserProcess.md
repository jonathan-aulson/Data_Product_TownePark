# Forecasting Actuals Display - Account Manager User Process

## Process Overview

This document provides comprehensive guidance for account managers to effectively view, analyze, and interpret forecasting actuals data within the forecasting system. The actuals display functionality enables account managers to compare forecasted values against actual performance data for informed decision-making.

## Prerequisites

### Required Access
- Account Manager role permissions
- Access to forecasting system
- Customer site assignments
- Actuals data viewing permissions

### Required Knowledge
- Basic forecasting concepts
- Customer site operations
- Financial data interpretation
- System navigation skills

## Process Steps

### Step 1: Access Forecasting Actuals Display
**Action:** Navigate to the forecasting system and access the actuals display module
**System Response:** System displays the actuals dashboard with available data views
**Decision Points:** 
- Select specific customer sites or view all assigned sites
- Choose date range for actuals comparison
- Select specific forecasting categories (revenue, expenses, statistics)
**Validation:** Verify correct customer sites are displayed and data permissions are active
**Error Handling:** If access denied, contact system administrator for permission verification
**Tips:** Use bookmark functionality to save frequently accessed actuals views

### Step 2: Configure Display Parameters
**Action:** Set up display parameters including date ranges, comparison periods, and data granularity
**System Response:** System updates the display based on selected parameters
**Decision Points:**
- Monthly, quarterly, or annual comparison periods
- Variance analysis thresholds
- Data aggregation levels (site, region, portfolio)
**Validation:** Confirm selected parameters align with analysis objectives
**Error Handling:** If data unavailable for selected parameters, system displays available alternatives
**Tips:** Save commonly used parameter configurations as templates for future use

### Step 3: Analyze Actuals vs. Forecast Variance
**Action:** Review variance analysis between forecasted and actual values
**System Response:** System displays variance calculations, percentages, and trend indicators
**Decision Points:**
- Investigate significant variances (>10% threshold)
- Identify patterns in over/under performance
- Determine if variances require forecast adjustments
**Validation:** Verify variance calculations are accurate and within expected ranges
**Error Handling:** If variance calculations appear incorrect, verify data sources and contact support
**Tips:** Use color-coded variance indicators to quickly identify areas requiring attention

### Step 4: Generate Actuals Analysis Reports
**Action:** Create reports summarizing actuals performance and variance analysis
**System Response:** System generates formatted reports with charts, tables, and summary statistics
**Decision Points:**
- Select report format (PDF, Excel, dashboard view)
- Choose recipients for report distribution
- Schedule recurring reports if needed
**Validation:** Review report accuracy and completeness before distribution
**Error Handling:** If report generation fails, check data availability and system status
**Tips:** Customize report templates to include key metrics relevant to stakeholders

### Step 5: Document Insights and Action Items
**Action:** Record key insights, trends, and recommended actions based on actuals analysis
**System Response:** System saves notes and action items linked to specific data points
**Decision Points:**
- Prioritize action items based on business impact
- Assign follow-up tasks to appropriate team members
- Set review dates for monitoring progress
**Validation:** Ensure all significant findings are documented with supporting data
**Error Handling:** If system fails to save notes, export findings to external documentation
**Tips:** Use standardized templates for consistent documentation across all analyses

## Alternative Flows

### Scenario: Limited Data Availability
When actuals data is incomplete or unavailable for selected periods:
1. System displays data availability status and gaps
2. User adjusts parameters to available data ranges
3. System provides partial analysis with data limitations noted
4. User documents data gaps and requests data updates from appropriate sources

### Scenario: Significant Variance Investigation
When variances exceed predefined thresholds:
1. System highlights exceptional variances with alerts
2. User drills down into detailed transaction data
3. System provides variance breakdown by category and time period
4. User initiates variance investigation workflow with stakeholders
