# District Manager Forecasting Workflow User Guide

## Document Overview

This user guide provides comprehensive workflow instructions for District Managers using the Towne Park Forecasting system. District Managers have unique responsibilities for overseeing multiple sites within their district, requiring specialized tools for aggregate analysis, multi-site management, and district-level forecasting oversight.

## Executive Summary

District Manager workflows focus on multi-site oversight, aggregate forecast analysis, and district-level performance management. Key capabilities include district filtering, aggregate forecast views, variance analysis across multiple sites, and the ability to edit forecasts for sites within their district. The system provides both high-level district summaries and detailed site-specific analysis tools.

## User Role and Permissions

### 1. District Manager Access Control

#### 1.1 Site Visibility and Access

**Access Scope:**
District Managers see only sites within their assigned district, providing focused management capabilities while maintaining data security.

**Example Access Pattern:**
> "Account manager for this site is Andre Johnson and the district manager is Peter Quinnen. So if I log in as Andre or Peter, this is the only site or if I'm Peter, only sites I'm going to see in this drop down are my district sites."

**Key Access Features:**
- **District-Scoped Site List:** Dropdown shows only district sites
- **Role-Based Filtering:** Automatic filtering based on user assignment
- **Secure Data Access:** No visibility into other districts' data
- **Hierarchical Permissions:** Can view and edit sites within district

#### 1.2 Permission Levels

**District Manager Capabilities:**
```
District Manager Permissions:
├── View all sites in assigned district
├── Edit forecasts for district sites
├── View aggregate district performance
├── Access district-level reporting
├── Filter and analyze across multiple sites
└── Compare sites within district
```

**Restricted Capabilities:**
- Cannot access sites outside assigned district
- Cannot modify district assignments
- Cannot access system administration functions
- Cannot view other districts' aggregate data

## Core Workflow Processes

### 2. District-Level Forecast Management

#### 2.1 Aggregate View Navigation

**Primary Workflow:**
> "From here the the the next like workflow to talk about is probably that of a district manager or above. And so that's where these filters kind of come into play as a district manager... Peter Quinnen is going to filter down to see just his district and apply that. And then from this view, we're going to see an aggregate of all of the forecasts for all of his district."

**Step-by-Step Process:**

1. **Access District View**
   - Log in with District Manager credentials
   - System automatically filters to district sites
   - Navigate to Forecasting module

2. **Apply District Filter**
   - Select district filter option
   - Choose specific district (if managing multiple)
   - Apply filter to activate district view

3. **Review Aggregate Data**
   - View combined forecast data for all district sites
   - Analyze district-level trends and patterns
   - Compare current period to budget and prior periods

4. **Identify Areas of Focus**
   - Review variance indicators across sites
   - Identify sites requiring attention
   - Prioritize sites for detailed analysis

#### 2.2 Multi-Site Analysis Capabilities

**Aggregate Analysis Features:**
- **Combined Forecast Views:** All district sites aggregated
- **Budget Comparison:** District total vs. budget targets
- **Trend Analysis:** Historical performance across district
- **Variance Identification:** Sites with significant variances
- **Performance Ranking:** Site performance comparison within district

**Analysis Workflow:**
```
District Analysis Process:
├── Aggregate View: Overall district performance
├── Site Comparison: Relative performance analysis
├── Variance Analysis: Identify outliers and trends
├── Drill-Down: Detailed site-specific investigation
└── Action Planning: Prioritize interventions and support
```

### 3. Site-Specific Management

#### 3.1 Individual Site Forecast Editing

**Editing Workflow:**
> "So for a district manager who wants to come in and and make changes to their district's forecast, the way they would do that is coming into the forecast. And selecting sites within their district. Essentially we're we're going to have the filters available here so that they can use that filter mechanism to select sites and edit."

**Site Selection Process:**

1. **Filter-Based Selection**
   - Use district filter to narrow site list
   - Select specific sites for editing
   - Maintain site-level granularity in edits

2. **Forecast Modification**
   - Access individual site forecast tabs
   - Make necessary adjustments to forecasts
   - Maintain data integrity across related tabs
