## Overview

This comprehensive user process guide provides billing administrators with detailed procedures for managing statements within the Towne Park billing system. The guide covers standard statement operations, accessing older statements through alternative navigation paths, and understanding statement lifecycle management to ensure complete visibility and control over all billing documentation.

## Prerequisites

### Required Access and Permissions
- Active Towne Park billing system user account
- Billing Administrator or Billing Manager role assignment
- Access to Customers tab and customer details functionality
- Statement management permissions for target customer accounts

### System Requirements
- Compatible web browser with current session authentication
- Stable internet connection for real-time data access
- Understanding of customer identification systems and numbering conventions

### Knowledge Prerequisites
- Basic familiarity with Towne Park billing system navigation
- Understanding of customer account structure and organization
- Knowledge of statement status categories and lifecycle stages
- Awareness of billing cycle timing and statement generation processes

## Process Overview

### Statement Management Workflow
The statement management process encompasses multiple access methods and navigation paths to ensure comprehensive statement visibility and management capabilities:

1. **Standard Statement Access**: Primary statements view with current and recent statements
2. **Historical Statement Access**: Customer details navigation for complete statement history
3. **Statement Status Management**: Understanding and managing statement lifecycle stages
4. **Error Resolution**: Procedures for addressing statement issues and regeneration needs

### Key Navigation Concepts
- **Main Statements View**: Filtered display optimized for current operations
- **Customer Details View**: Comprehensive historical access without filtering restrictions
- **Statement Status Filtering**: Automatic filtering based on age and status criteria
- **Alternative Access Paths**: Multiple routes to access the same statement data

## Standard Statement Management Procedures

### Accessing Current Statements

#### Primary Navigation Path
1. **Login to Billing System**
   - Navigate to Towne Park billing system URL
   - Enter valid credentials and authenticate
   - Verify successful login and system access

2. **Navigate to Statements Section**
   - Locate and click on "Statements" tab in main navigation
   - Wait for statements list to load completely
   - Verify that current period statements are displayed

3. **Review Statement List**
   - Examine displayed statements for current billing period
   - Note statement status indicators (Draft, Pending, Sent, etc.)
   - Identify any statements requiring attention or action

#### Statement List Features
- **Automatic Filtering**: System automatically filters older statements from main view
- **Status Indicators**: Clear visual indicators for statement processing status
- **Quick Actions**: Direct access to common statement operations
- **Search Functionality**: Ability to search for specific statements or customers

### Standard Statement Operations

#### Viewing Statement Details
1. **Select Target Statement**
   - Locate desired statement in the statements list
   - Click on statement identifier or customer name
   - Wait for statement details to load

2. **Review Statement Content**
   - Examine statement header information and billing period
   - Verify customer details and billing address accuracy
   - Review line items, charges, and calculation accuracy
   - Check for any errors or discrepancies requiring correction

3. **Perform Required Actions**
   - Update statement status as appropriate
   - Add notes or comments for internal tracking
   - Initiate approval workflows if required
   - Generate final statement documents for distribution

## Accessing Older Statements - Alternative Navigation

### When to Use Alternative Navigation
The alternative navigation method through customer details is required when:
- Older statements are not visible in the main statements view
- Historical statement research is needed for customer inquiries
- Statement regeneration is required for previously processed statements
- Comprehensive statement history review is necessary

### Step-by-Step Alternative Navigation Procedure

#### Step 1: Navigate to Customers Tab
1. **Access Customer Management**
   - Click on "Customers" tab in main navigation menu
   - Wait for customer list to load completely
   - Verify that customer search and filter options are available

2. **Locate Target Customer**
   - Use search functionality to find specific customer
   - Enter customer ID (e.g., "0480") in search field
   - Alternatively, browse customer list using filters or sorting options
   - Verify correct customer identification before proceeding

#### Step 2: Access Customer Details
1. **Select Customer Record**
   - Click on target customer name or ID in the customer list
   - Wait for customer details page to load completely
   - Verify that customer information displays correctly

2. **Navigate Customer Details Interface**
   - Review customer details page layout and available tabs
   - Locate "Statements" tab within customer details interface
   - Note other available tabs for comprehensive customer management

#### Step 3: Access Complete Statement History
1. **Click Statements Tab**
   - Select "Statements" tab within customer details view
   - Wait for complete statement history to load
   - Verify that all statements for the customer are now visible

2. **Review Complete Statement History**
   - Examine all statements regardless of age or status
   - Note that filtering restrictions from main view do not apply
   - Access older statements that were hidden from main statements list

### Technical Implementation Details

#### System Architecture for Statement Access
Christopher Thompson's explanation of the dual access system:

"However, you can still go if you go to the Customers tab and you view the customer details for 0480... and then view that and then go to the statements tab on here. You will still see [the statement]."

**Key Technical Points:**
- **Main Statements View**: Applies age-based and status-based filtering
- **Customer Details View**: Bypasses filtering for complete historical access
- **Data Consistency**: Same underlying data accessed through different interfaces
- **UI Design Philosophy**: Balance between operational efficiency and comprehensive access

#### Navigation Path Summary
```
Main Navigation → Customers Tab → Customer Selection → Customer Details → Statements Tab
```

**Alternative Path Benefits:**
- Complete statement history visibility
- No age-based filtering restrictions
- Access to all statement statuses
- Comprehensive customer statement management

## Statement Lifecycle Management

### Understanding Statement Status Categories

#### Draft Status
- **Description**: Statements in preparation phase
- **Visibility**: Available in both main view and customer details
- **Actions Available**: Edit, modify, delete, advance to next status
- **User Responsibilities**: Review accuracy, complete required fields, validate calculations

#### Pending Status

   - Verify that corrections are properly reflected in new statement
   - Compare new statement with original to confirm accuracy

4. **Update Statement Status**
   - Update statement status to reflect regeneration
   - Add notes documenting reasons for regeneration and changes made
   - Notify relevant stakeholders of statement updates
