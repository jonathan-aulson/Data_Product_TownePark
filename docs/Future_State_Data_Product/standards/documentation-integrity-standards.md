# Documentation Integrity Standards

## Overview

This document establishes comprehensive standards and procedures for ensuring documentation accuracy, preventing AI hallucinations, and maintaining data integrity across all Towne Park documentation systems. These standards are critical for maintaining trust and reliability in our documentation ecosystem.

## Critical Incident Background

**Date**: 2025-07-28  
**Issue**: Discovery of hallucinated meeting notes document containing fabricated team members, fictional meetings, and false technical decisions  
**Impact**: Potential for false decision-making based on non-existent historical records  
**Resolution**: Document deleted and all references removed  
**Lesson**: Need for comprehensive safeguards against AI-generated false content  

## Core Integrity Principles

### 1. Source Verification Requirement
- **MANDATORY**: All factual content must have verifiable sources
- **NO EXCEPTIONS**: Never create content about real people, meetings, or events without verified source material
- **VERIFICATION FIRST**: Verify before document, not document then verify

### 2. Content Classification System
- **FACTUAL**: Based on verified sources (meetings, decisions, actual events)
- **TEMPLATE**: Example or template content clearly marked as such
- **ANALYTICAL**: Analysis or recommendations based on verified data
- **FICTIONAL**: Training or example content with clearly fictional elements

### 3. Human Validation Gates
- **CRITICAL CONTENT**: All meeting notes, team communications, and historical records require human validation
- **STAKEHOLDER CONFIRMATION**: People mentioned in documents must confirm accuracy
- **EXPERT REVIEW**: Technical content requires subject matter expert review

## Document Classification Framework

### High-Risk Document Types (Require Enhanced Validation)

#### Meeting Notes and Team Communications
- **Risk Level**: CRITICAL
- **Requirements**: 
  - Source recording or verified notes required
  - All attendees must confirm accuracy
  - No fictional names or events permitted
- **Validation**: Human review + stakeholder confirmation

#### Historical Records and Decisions
- **Risk Level**: CRITICAL
- **Requirements**:
  - Decision documentation with date and authority
  - Cross-reference with official records
  - Clear attribution to decision makers
- **Validation**: Management approval required

#### Personnel and Organizational Information
- **Risk Level**: HIGH
- **Requirements**:
  - Verify all names and roles with HR/management
  - No fictional team members or organizational structures
  - Current and accurate contact information
- **Validation**: HR verification required

#### Financial and Performance Data
- **Risk Level**: HIGH
- **Requirements**:
  - Source data from verified systems
  - No estimated or fictional metrics
  - Clear data source attribution
- **Validation**: Finance team approval required

### Medium-Risk Document Types

#### Technical Specifications
- **Risk Level**: MEDIUM
- **Requirements**:
  - Based on actual system implementations
  - Code validation against real repositories
  - No fictional technical capabilities
- **Validation**: Technical lead review

#### Process Documentation
- **Risk Level**: MEDIUM
- **Requirements**:
  - Based on actual implemented processes
  - Stakeholder confirmation of accuracy
  - Regular review and updates
- **Validation**: Process owner approval

### Low-Risk Document Types

#### Templates and Examples
- **Risk Level**: LOW
- **Requirements**:
  - Clearly marked as templates
  - Use obviously fictional examples
  - Include disclaimer about example nature
- **Validation**: Standard review process

## Mandatory Frontmatter Standards

### Required Fields for All Documents
```yaml
---
title: "Document Title"
description: "Clear description of document content and purpose"
created_date: YYYY-MM-DD
last_updated_date: YYYY-MM-DD
version: X.Y
status: "Draft|Active|Archived|Template"
owner: "Responsible Team/Person"
content_type: "factual|template|analytical|example"
verification_status: "verified|pending|unverified"
---
```

### Additional Fields for High-Risk Documents
```yaml
source_verification: "Required - link to source material"
source_documents:
  - "path/to/source1.ext"
  - "path/to/source2.ext"
attendees_confirmed: true|false  # For meeting notes
stakeholders_notified: true|false  # For personnel content
data_source: "System/Database name"  # For data content
verified_by: "Name of verifying person"
verification_date: YYYY-MM-DD
approval_required: true|false
approved_by: "Name of approving authority"
approval_date: YYYY-MM-DD
```

## AI Content Generation Guidelines

### Prohibited AI Activities
1. **NEVER** generate meeting notes without source recordings/notes
2. **NEVER** create fictional team member names or roles
3. **NEVER** fabricate historical events or decisions
4. **NEVER** generate performance metrics without source data
5. **NEVER** create organizational charts without HR verification

### Required AI Safeguards
1. **Source Requirement**: AI must request source material before generating factual content
2. **Verification Prompts**: AI must include verification requirements in all factual documents
3. **Disclaimer Requirements**: AI must include appropriate disclaimers for template/example content
4. **Human Review Flags**: AI must flag high-risk content for human review

### AI Prompt Standards
```
CRITICAL INSTRUCTION: Before generating any content about real people, meetings, 
events, or organizational information, you MUST:
1. Request and verify source material
2. Confirm all names and details are factual
3. Include appropriate verification frontmatter
4. Flag for human review if any uncertainty exists

NEVER create fictional content presented as factual.
```

## Validation Procedures

### Pre-Publication Validation

#### Step 1: Content Classification
- [ ] Document type identified and risk level assigned
- [ ] Appropriate frontmatter template applied
- [ ] Content type clearly specified

#### Step 2: Source Verification
- [ ] All factual claims have identified sources
- [ ] Source materials are accessible and verified
- [ ] No fictional elements in factual content

#### Step 3: Stakeholder Review
- [ ] Relevant stakeholders identified
- [ ] Review requests sent to appropriate parties
- [ ] Feedback incorporated and documented

#### Step 4: Technical Validation
