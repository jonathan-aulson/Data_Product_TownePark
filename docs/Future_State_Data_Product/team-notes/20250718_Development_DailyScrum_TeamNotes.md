# Towne Park Development - Daily Scrum Team Notes

## Purpose

This document serves as a comprehensive reference for key development decisions, issue resolution, and operational insights gathered from daily scrum meetings between June 27 and July 1, 2025. It provides essential information for team coordination, decision tracking, and knowledge management across the billing and forecasting systems development efforts.

## Executive Summary

The daily scrum sessions covered critical development activities including historical statement generation, payroll data visualization challenges, monitoring implementation, and bug resolution. The team successfully completed statement generation for 152 of 157 sites, identified and resolved multiple forecast-related bugs, and established clear visibility rules for statement management. Key operational decisions were made regarding statement thresholds, UI behavior, and development priorities.

## Billing System Development Notes

### Historical Statement Generation

#### Implementation Success
**Completed**: Successfully generated prior month statements for all sites requested by Amy Sowells
- **Total Sites Processed**: 157 sites
- **Success Rate**: 152 sites (96.8% success rate)
- **Failed Sites**: 5 sites experiencing errors
- **Confidence Level**: High confidence that July statements will work for successful sites

**Key Implementation Details**:
- All prior month statements generated as requested
- Comprehensive processing of site list provided by Amy
- Robust error handling and reporting for failed sites
- Validation process confirmed successful generation

#### Technical Approach
**Developer Insight** (Shravan Modi): "I have finished with all the mentioned site by Amy and generated all the prior month statement."

**Quality Assurance** (Pratik Bedekar): "The we got the 157 sites in this Excel and out of those only five got error. So we are sure that 150 documents will definitely work because we were able to generate January through April straight away."

#### Outstanding Issues
- **Error Sites**: 5 sites require further investigation for statement generation failures
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Pending investigation into specific error conditions
- **Resolution Timeline**: To be determined based on error analysis

### Statement Visibility Rules

#### Business Logic Implementation
**Implemented**: Statement visibility rules based on billing cycle dates
- **Current Month**: Always visible in main list
- **Previous Month**: Always visible in main list
- **Older Statements**: Hidden from main list if in "sent" status
- **Alternative Access**: Available through Customers tab → Customer Details → Statements

#### Technical Implementation Details
**UI Behavior** (Christopher Thompson): "If the, I think it's tied to the... That the billing, it's either the billing cycle or the service period. But basically if it's if it's not a statement that was generated like this month, right. So you said the May statement which was generated in June. Now that it's July, if it's in a if it was a sent status, it's removed from this list."

**Business Logic** (Jonathan Aulson): "So that's the logic built into this view. So it will because it's July 1st, May statements are now hidden. So what we do is we show last month and this month."

#### Access Patterns
- **Primary Access**: Main statement list shows current and previous month
- **Secondary Access**: Customer-specific statement history remains fully accessible
- **Status Dependency**: Only "sent" statements are hidden from main view

### Threshold Review Process

#### Business Process Decision
**Decision**: Amy Sowells has sufficient time to review statement thresholds - not urgent priority
- **Review Scope**: All historical invoice amounts and validation
- **Threshold Validation**: Ensure correctness for future statement generation
- **Timeline**: Flexible timeline allows thorough review
- **Contingency**: Statements can be regenerated if issues are identified

**Business Context** (Jonathan Aulson): "Amy has a task, right? She has to review the amounts on all of those invoices and validate that, uh, they're correct... So that the threshold amounts will be correct... from here on out and I'm trying to figure out do I do I have to tell her that she has to review those today and and get it done or does she have more time and I think she has more time."

### Monitoring and Alerting Implementation

#### Development Progress
**Status**: Documentation and planning phase completed
- **Deliverable**: Alerting and monitoring spreadsheet prepared by Pratik Bedekar
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive approach outlined for implementation
- **Integration Point**: Dataverse integration for alerting capabilities
- **Next Steps**: Implementation phase based on documented approach

**Acknowledgment** (Jonathan Aulson): "I received the alerting and monitoring and alerting spreadsheet you sent, which is great."

#### Technical Architecture
- **Platform**: Dataverse integration for alerting infrastructure
- **Scope**: Monitoring capabilities for billing system operations
- **Documentation**: Detailed spreadsheet outlining implementation approach
- **Timeline**: Implementation phase to follow documentation review

## Forecasting System Development Notes

### Payroll Data Visualization

#### Critical Issue Identification
**Issue**: Ambiguity in daily payroll hours visualization for GSA and GSC job codes
- **Symptom**: Displayed hours don't align with monthly actuals
- **Example**: GSC shows 15 hours but monthly actual is 334 hours
- **Scope**: Affects daily granularity display for multiple job codes
- **Impact**: User confusion and potential data integrity concerns

#### Technical Investigation
**Problem Details** (Gayasuddin Gayasi): "For GSA if you see it's showing for for this week it is 15 hours, but for GSA it's different for every day, so I don't know how to calculate this."

**Analysis** (Jonathan Aulson): "For GSGSC, the number in black is 15 hours, but that doesn't track with a monthly actual of 334."

#### Resolution Approach
**Technical Solution** (Christopher Thompson): "Well, let me yeah and and I can add to the story the the the database queries so you can look at them because because actual and scheduled data we actually get a a a daily granularity, right. So we know which days we're not taking like the full month and dividing it by 30."

**Action Items**:
- Christopher Thompson to add database queries to the story for reference
- Team to review calculation methodology for daily hour display
- Investigation into discrepancy between daily and monthly values
- Clarification of data aggregation logic for payroll visualization

#### Data Architecture Context
- **Granularity**: System maintains daily granularity for actual and scheduled data
- **Calculation**: Not using simple monthly division (month/30 approach)
- **Display Logic**: Hover functionality shows combined hours for all job codes
- **Data Sources**: Direct database queries provide daily payroll information

## Development Operations and Quality Assurance

### Bug Resolution Activities

#### Forecast Bug Fixes
**Bug #2316**: Successfully resolved and pull request submitted
- **Status**: Fixed and PR raised for review
- **Developer**: Kajal Singh
- **Impact**: Forecast functionality improvement

**Persistent Issue**: Forecast saving functionality
- **Status**: Unresolved despite previous fix attempts
- **Context**: Cesar made changes but issue persists
- **Communication**: Kajal has informed Cesar of continued problems
- **Action Required**: Further investigation and resolution needed

#### Technical Implementation Details
**Development Update** (Shravan Modi): "From the team side Kajal was work Kajal, Kajal was verifying one of the issue while saving the forecast as Cesar as Cesar had made some changes on that part but still it is not working. She already informed him. That, she told me. And apart from it, she was working, started working on forecast bug 2316 and which is now fixed and she raised [PR]"

### Sprint Planning and Coordination
