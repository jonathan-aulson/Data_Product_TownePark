# Sprint Planning Team Notes - Final Stretch Coordination

## Meeting Overview

**Meeting Date:** June 12, 2025  
**Meeting Type:** Backlog Grooming - Final Sprint Planning  
**Duration:** 1 hour 5 minutes  
**Focus Area:** Final 5 sprints prioritization and pilot timeline coordination

**Participants:**
- **Jonathan Aulson** - Business Analyst
- **Amy Sowells** - Product Owner  
- **Adam Suarez** - Product Owner
- **Christopher Thompson** - Team Member
- **Michael Foy** - Team Member

## Strategic Planning Coordination

### 1. Final Sprint Timeline Coordination

**Strategic Context:** Final 5 sprints remaining in forecasting project  
**Coordination Challenge:** Balancing feature completeness with pilot timeline  
**Decision Date:** June 12, 2025

**Team Discussion Summary:**
Jonathan provided critical timeline context: "We're down to the last 5 sprints left. So we're we're getting down to the final stretch here."

**Sprint Allocation Strategy:**
- **Current Sprint:** Payroll forecasting features completion
- **Next Sprint:** Internal Revenue for per labor hour management agreements
- **Following Sprint:** Legion data integration implementation
- **Final 2 Sprints:** Feature prioritization based on team decisions

**Team Coordination Outcomes:**
- Established urgency for feature prioritization decisions
- Identified need for strategic trade-offs between scope and timeline
- Coordinated approach to balance desired features vs. committed deliverables
- Aligned team on final stretch execution strategy

### 2. Feature Prioritization Coordination

**Decision ID:** D009  
**Decision Date:** June 12, 2025  
**Decision Owner:** Jonathan Aulson  
**Status:** Approved

**Team Discussion Summary:**
Jonathan raised critical design question: "For example, the set of comparison to prior year stories. I included these in here because in the features list we talk about comparing to budget and prior year on all the tabs I did want to kind of point out that the the tabs do have the ability to compare to prior year. It doesn't work the same as with budget where it's a like you click a button and it shows the the numbers underneath. You actually just change the year."

Amy provided user perspective: "I think I don't know. I don't like weigh in. I don't. I know you know how these managers use it more than I do."

**Team Coordination Activities:**
- **Prior Year Comparison Decision:** Feature considered complete with existing year-change functionality
- **UI Simplification:** No additional side-by-side comparison interface needed
- **Resource Reallocation:** Development effort redirected to higher priority features
- **User Experience Validation:** Confirmed existing functionality meets user needs

### 3. Topside Adjustments Requirements Coordination

**Requirement Analysis Date:** June 12, 2025  
**Stakeholders:** Jonathan Aulson, Adam Suarez, Christopher Thompson  
**Status:** Under Discussion - Alignment Needed

**Team Discussion Summary:**
Jonathan sought clarification: "So this guy inputs in P&L view for topside. Can can you kind of walk me through what this might look like in the tool?"

Adam explained the concept: "So I sort of talked to, I think, Mike, you were there too. For these, I don't. I don't know where fully aligned on what exactly we want. These are more. Like manual input, so it's not like you're going by day and entering cars like this is almost going by month and just inputting P&L data. Like, because there's there's so many different."

**Team Coordination Outcomes:**
- **Requirement Clarification:** Topside adjustments are monthly manual P&L data inputs
- **Scope Definition:** Not daily transactional data like statistics
- **Complexity Assessment:** Variety of adjustment types creates implementation challenges
- **Alignment Action:** Additional coordination needed on exact requirements

### 4. Pilot Timeline Adjustment Coordination

**Decision ID:** D010, D011  
**Decision Date:** June 12, 2025  
**Decision Owner:** Amy Sowells  
**Status:** Approved - Urgent Communication Required

**Team Discussion Summary:**
Jonathan explained timeline challenge: "What I was proposing was that we prioritize all the user features into these four and do and have the last Sprint be non functional... Those non functional we are. We're actually getting done ahead of time."

He revealed critical impact: "So I think we need to go back to Jeremy and and and reset the expectation on when we could be ready to pilot if we wanna pilot with all these things."

**Timeline Coordination Details:**
- **Original Development End:** August 12th
- **New Functional Features End:** August 26th
- **Timeline Shift:** 2-week extension for pilot readiness
- **Scope Impact:** Increased compared to original features list

**Team Coordination Activities:**
- **Risk Assessment:** Concurrent UAT and pilot execution strategy
- **Communication Planning:** Immediate notification to Jeremy required
- **Resource Allocation:** Final sprint dedicated to non-functional requirements
- **Quality Strategy:** Early pilot issues caught during concurrent UAT

### 5. AI Initiative Progress Coordination

**Initiative Update Date:** June 12, 2025  
**Lead:** Jonathan Aulson  
**Status:** Positive Results - Sharing Planned

**Team Discussion Summary:**
Jonathan shared positive news: "We were just meeting internally to compare notes on some AI initiatives we're we're working on within our team. We're getting some really positive results, so I'm hopeful we can kind of come back and share with you guys soon, but. We're we're we've implemented some new tools and they're really working out well, is the headline."

When Adam asked about application, Jonathan clarified: "Really both [forecasting and billing]. But it's more applicable to forecasting because we're doing a lot more work there these days."

**Team Coordination Outcomes:**
- **Productivity Improvements:** AI tools showing positive results across projects
- **Focus Area:** More applicable to forecasting due to current workload intensity
- **Knowledge Sharing:** Plans to share results with product team
- **Implementation Success:** New tools working out well for development team

## Critical Coordination Activities

### Immediate Actions (Week of June 12, 2025)
1. **Amy Sowells** - Schedule 30-minute meeting with Jeremy for pilot timeline communication
2. **Jonathan Aulson** - Finalize feature prioritization groupings for remaining sprints
3. **Adam Suarez** - Clarify topside adjustments requirements with stakeholders
4. **Development Team** - Continue current sprint payroll forecasting features

### Sprint Planning Coordination
1. **Product Owners** - Approve final feature prioritization rankings
2. **Business Analyst** - Document prioritization methodology and rationale
3. **Development Team** - Estimate effort for prioritized features
4. **Project Coordination** - Align pilot planning with development timeline

### Risk Mitigation Coordination
