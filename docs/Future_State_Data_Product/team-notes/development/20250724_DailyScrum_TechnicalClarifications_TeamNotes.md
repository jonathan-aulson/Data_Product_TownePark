# Towne Park Financial Systems - Daily Scrum Technical Clarifications Team Notes

## Purpose

This document captures critical technical clarifications, implementation decisions, and issue identification from the July 1, 2025 daily scrum meeting. The session focused on resolving technical questions about payroll data query implementation and statement management functionality, providing essential clarity for ongoing development work.

## Meeting Overview

### Session Summary
**Meeting Date:** July 1, 2025  
**Meeting Type:** Daily Scrum (Additional Technical Discussion)  
**Primary Focus:** Technical clarifications and implementation details  
**Key Participants:** Christopher Thompson (Developer), Gayasuddin Gayasi (Tester), Jonathan Aulson (Business Analyst)

### Key Outcomes
- Clarified payroll data query implementation approach
- Resolved questions about statement access methodology
- Identified UI display inconsistencies requiring attention
- Established documentation requirements for database queries

## Critical Technical Decisions

### Decision D009: Database Query Documentation in User Stories
**Date:** 2025-07-01  
**Decision Owner:** Christopher Thompson (Developer)  
**Status:** Approved  
**Affected Features:** Forecasting - Payroll Data Visualization

**Decision Details:**
Christopher Thompson committed to including actual database queries in user stories to provide transparency and enable team review of calculation methodologies.

**Implementation Requirements:**
- Add specific database queries to payroll visualization user stories
- Include both "payroll schedule" and "payroll actuals" queries
- Provide query documentation for team review and validation
- Enable stakeholders to understand exact calculation approaches

**Rationale:** Team needed visibility into how payroll data is retrieved and processed to ensure accuracy and identify potential discrepancies in data display.

**Christopher's Commitment:**
"And and I can add to the story the the the database queries so you can look at them because because actual and scheduled data we actually get a a a daily granularity, right."

### Decision D010: Statement Access Through Customer Details
**Date:** 2025-07-01  
**Decision Owner:** Christopher Thompson (Developer)  
**Status:** Confirmed  
**Affected Features:** Billing - Statement Management

**Decision Details:**
Confirmed that older statements remain accessible through the customer details view, even when filtered from the main statements list.

**Navigation Implementation:**
1. Access Customers tab
2. Select specific customer (e.g., customer ID 0480)
3. View customer details
4. Navigate to Statements tab within customer details
5. All statements visible regardless of age or status

**Technical Architecture:**
- Main statements view applies age-based filtering
- Customer details view bypasses filtering for complete statement history
- Design balances UI cleanliness with data accessibility requirements

## Technical Implementation Clarifications

### Payroll Data Query Architecture

**Daily Granularity Implementation:**
Christopher Thompson clarified the sophisticated approach to payroll data retrieval:

"So we know which days we're not taking like the full month and dividing it by 30 or 31 or whatever. We're actually running a query that gets us info for every day."

**Technical Specifications:**
- Database queries retrieve data at daily granularity level
- System avoids simple monthly total division by days in month
- Specific daily data available for both actual and scheduled hours
- Queries provide precise daily breakdown for accurate calculations

**Query Types Documented:**
- **Payroll Schedule Queries**: Retrieve planned/scheduled hours by day
- **Payroll Actuals Queries**: Retrieve actual worked hours by day
- **Combined Queries**: Aggregate data across job codes for display

**Implementation Benefits:**
- Accurate daily-level data representation
- Eliminates estimation errors from monthly averaging
- Enables precise variance analysis between scheduled and actual
- Supports detailed forecasting calculations

### User Interface Behavior Specifications

**Hover Functionality Implementation:**
Christopher Thompson explained the detailed hover behavior for payroll data display:

"Oh, so if you hover over the whole day, like on Monday, June 2nd, go up. There you go. So that shows like the full scheduled for all the job codes combined for actual and scheduled."

**UI Interaction Specifications:**
- Hovering over any date displays combined hours for all job codes
- Hover tooltip shows both actual and scheduled hours simultaneously
- Data aggregation occurs in real-time for hover display
- Provides immediate access to detailed daily information

**Display Components:**
- **Date Selection**: Hover target over specific calendar dates
- **Aggregated Display**: Combined totals across all job codes
- **Dual Data View**: Both actual and scheduled hours in single tooltip
- **Real-time Calculation**: Dynamic aggregation for hover interaction

## Issues Identified and Resolution Requirements

### Issue: UI Display Inconsistency
**Identified By:** Jonathan Aulson (Business Analyst)  
**Date:** 2025-07-01  
**Severity:** Medium  
**Affected Features:** Forecasting - Payroll Data Display

**Issue Description:**
Jonathan identified potential inconsistency between displayed values and expected calculations:

"Which if you look at the, if you look at the roll up right for them for Monday, June 2nd, 136.1 hover over Mondays again. So we're showing actual there. So then my assumption would be that we are showing in the black text we're showing we should be showing the actual number all the way down and then showing budget next to it."

**Specific Inconsistencies:**
- Black text display values don't align with monthly actuals
- GSC showing 15 hours daily doesn't correlate with 334 hours monthly actual
- GSA displays different values for each day without clear pattern
- Rollup calculations may not match individual day summations

**Resolution Requirements:**
- Verify calculation methodology for daily vs. monthly displays
- Ensure consistent data source usage across all display components
- Clarify whether black text should show actual or scheduled values
- Implement consistent labeling and data representation

**Next Steps:**
- Review database queries to understand data source discrepancies
- Validate calculation logic for daily aggregations
- Establish clear UI standards for actual vs. scheduled display
- Test hover functionality against expected calculation results

### Issue: Statement Regeneration Concerns
**Identified By:** Team Discussion  
**Date:** 2025-07-01  
**Severity:** Low  
**Affected Features:** Billing - Statement Management

**Issue Description:**
Potential complications if errors are discovered in older statements that have been filtered from main view.

**Risk Assessment:**
- Older statements remain accessible but require specific navigation
- Error correction may require statement regeneration
- Users might not be aware of alternative access path
- Training needed for statement management procedures

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Document clear navigation procedures for accessing older statements
- Establish error correction workflows for filtered statements
- Provide user training on customer details navigation
- Consider UI improvements for statement access visibility

## Development Coordination Activities

### Query Documentation Requirements

**Christopher Thompson's Action Items:**
