## Development Progress Tracking

### Billing System Enhancements

#### Historical Statement Generation Implementation
**Lead Developer**: Pratik Bedekar  
**Business Analyst**: Jonathan Aulson  
**Status**: Completed  
**Priority**: High  

**Business Requirement:**
Amy Sowells requested the ability to generate historical statements for validation purposes while ensuring they don't clutter the main UI interface.

**Implementation Approach:**
- Generate statements for January through April for 157 sites
- Set appropriate status to hide statements from main view
- Maintain accessibility through customer details view
- Prevent accidental sending to clients

**Technical Implementation Details:**
```
Target Period: January - April 2025
Site Count: 157 sites
Status Setting: "Sent" status to remove from main view
Access Method: Customer details view for review
```

**Jonathan Aulson's Requirements**: "She's also wanting to get those statements kind of essentially hidden from view once they're generated so that they're not kind of clogging up the statements table in the UI."

**Pratik's Understanding**: "We understood that she basically want to generate all the 157 sites January through January to April. All the statements again and... She want that we we should not click on the send button so that it it it should send to the client and it creates a mess up."

**Key Success Criteria:**
- Historical statements generated for validation
- Statements hidden from main UI view
- No accidental client transmission
- Accessible for internal review when needed

#### Starting Month Reset Bug Fix
**Lead Developer**: Andrew Scheuer  
**Tester**: Gayasuddin Gayasi  
**Status**: Completed  
**Priority**: Medium  

**Issue Description:**
The starting month was not properly resetting to the queried month when performing certain operations, causing confusion in the user interface.

**Resolution Approach:**
- Identified and categorized as a bug
- Implemented fix to set starting month to match queried month
- Verified functionality through testing

**Andrew Scheuer's Confirmation**: "And and the one that you had in question regarding the starting month be not being reset. That's been fixed as well and we we set that that was a bug. So we we set the starting month to the to the the queried month."

**Testing Validation:**
- Gayasuddin Gayasi confirmed fix functionality
- No regression issues identified
- User experience improved

### User Interface Improvements

#### Month Change Dialog Enhancement
**Reporter**: Gayasuddin Gayasi  
**Business Analyst**: Jonathan Aulson  
**Status**: Low Priority Issue  
**System**: Forecasting  

**Issue Identification:**
The dialog message displayed when changing months with unsaved changes is misleading and doesn't accurately reflect the actual system behavior.

**Current vs. Actual Behavior:**
- **Dialog Text**: "Changes will be lost if you continue, your changes will be lost if you continue"
- **Actual Behavior**: Changes are retained in the UI but not saved to the database
- **User Confusion**: Dialog suggests complete loss when changes persist in interface

**Gayasuddin's Observation**: "And that rates changes that we have done previously before changing the month. It's still there."

**Jonathan's Assessment**: "That is, that is in this use case, this text is a business meeting. I'm gonna mark this a low priority bug and we'll we'll think about how to tweak that messaging to be something a little less confusing."

**Resolution Plan:**
- Revise dialog text to accurately reflect behavior
- Clarify that changes remain in UI but require saving
- Low priority due to minimal functional impact
- Consider user experience improvements

### System Performance Optimization

#### API Save Operation Performance Issue
**Lead Developer**: Andrew Scheuer  
**Status**: Open Issue  
**Priority**: High  
**Impact**: Performance degradation  

**Issue Description:**
The "save all" API operation is experiencing significant performance degradation, taking approximately 30 seconds to complete operations that should be much faster.

**Technical Details:**
- **Response Time**: ~30 seconds per save all operation
- **Attempted Solution**: Breaking into three separate calls
- **Result**: Each separate call still takes 30 seconds
- **Current Impact**: Not blocking development but affecting user experience

**Andrew's Report**: "The only one that wasn't fixed was the API response when we do save all taking like 30 seconds. And that that hasn't affected me. Tried breaking it up in the front end to three separate calls with those, each took 30 seconds."

**Investigation Areas:**
1. **Database Performance Analysis**
   - Query optimization opportunities
   - Index effectiveness review
   - Connection pooling efficiency

2. **API Architecture Review**
   - Synchronous vs. asynchronous processing
   - Batch operation optimization
   - Caching strategies

3. **Network and Infrastructure**
   - Latency analysis
   - Resource utilization monitoring
   - Scaling considerations

**Potential Solutions:**
- Implement asynchronous processing for large operations
- Optimize database queries and indexing
- Consider batch processing with progress indicators
- Implement caching for frequently accessed data

### Environment Management Activities

#### Environment Replication for PLH Sites
**Lead Developer**: Cesar Figueroa  
**Collaborator**: Diane (Database Specialist)  
**Status**: In Progress  
**Priority**: Medium  

**Project Scope:**
Replicating environment data for 2025 periods with specific focus on completing Per Labor Hour (PLH) site data migration.

**Current Status:**
- Copy operation for 2025 periods tested and validated
- PLH (Per Labor Hour) sites data identified as missing component
- Working with Diane to develop validation queries
- Planning dependency analysis for complete data copying

**Cesar's Progress Report**: "Then I had a meeting with Diane. We reviewed the content of the copy that I did as the testing for the rest of the 2025 periods. Looks like for now, only per labor hour is missing."

**Technical Implementation Approach:**
1. **Validation Query Development**
   - Diane providing validation query for data integrity
   - Query will identify missing dependencies
   - Used to ensure complete PLH data copying

2. **Dependency Analysis**
   - Identify all dependencies required for PLH data
   - Map data relationships and constraints
   - Ensure referential integrity during copy operations

3. **Copy Operation Execution**
   - "Duplicate based on copy" implementation
   - Systematic approach to data replication
   - Quality assurance validation throughout process

**Next Steps:**
- Receive and implement validation query from Diane
- Complete dependency mapping for PLH sites
- Execute final copy operations with validation
- Perform comprehensive testing of replicated environment
