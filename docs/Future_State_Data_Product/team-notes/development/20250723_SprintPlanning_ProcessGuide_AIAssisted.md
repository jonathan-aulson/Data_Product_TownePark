   - Plan for code review and quality assurance activities
   - Finalize sprint commitment and story selection

### Phase 3: Task Breakdown and Planning (60-90 minutes)
**Objective:** Break down stories into actionable tasks  
**Participants:** Development Team  
**AI Support:** Task generation and dependency analysis

**Activities:**
1. **Story Decomposition**
   - Break stories into development tasks
   - Use AI tools to suggest task breakdown patterns
   - Identify technical dependencies and integration points
   - Plan testing and validation activities

2. **Development Workflow Planning**
   - Plan development sequence and dependencies
   - Integrate AI tools into development workflow
   - Establish code review and quality check processes
   - Configure automated testing and validation

3. **Risk Assessment and Mitigation**
   - Identify technical and process risks
