## Quick Reference

| Issue Type | Severity | Resolution Time | Status |
|------------|----------|-----------------|--------|
| Divide by Zero Error | High | Same Day | Resolved |
| Trailing Zeros Display | Medium | Same Day | Resolved |
| Invalid Date Handling | High | Same Day | Resolved |

## Technical Issues Catalog

### 1. Invoice Generation Issues

#### 1.1 Divide by Zero Error in Revenue Amount Calculation

**Issue ID:** I005  
**Date Identified:** 2025-06-17  
**Reported By:** Shravan Modi  
**Severity:** High  
**Status:** Resolved  

**Problem Description:**
Flow triggered before database values were updated, resulting in zero values being used in revenue amount calculations, causing divide by zero errors.

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- Race condition between flow trigger and database update
- Flow execution timing was 4 minutes before database value update
- Zero values from database caused division errors

**Technical Details:**
```
Error Location: Revenue amount calculation flow
Trigger Timing: 4 minutes before database update
Error Type: Division by zero
Affected Component: Invoice generation process
```

**Resolution Steps:**
1. Identified timing issue in flow execution
2. Confirmed race condition pattern
3. Implemented retry mechanism for affected statements
4. Advised users to retry statement generation for affected sites

**Prevention Measures:**
- Add validation checks for zero values before calculations
- Implement proper flow sequencing with database updates
- Add error handling for race conditions

**Code Validation Status:**
✅ **VALIDATED** - Issue documented in Power Automate flows for invoice generation

#### 1.2 Trailing Zeros Display Issue

**Issue ID:** I006  
**Date Identified:** 2025-06-18  
**Reported By:** Shravan Modi  
**Severity:** Medium  
**Status:** Resolved  

**Problem Description:**
Invoice descriptions for regular and overtime hours displayed unnecessary trailing zeros up to four decimal places, even when values were not meaningful.

**Technical Details:**
```
Bug Number: 2344
Affected Fields: Regular hours description, Overtime hours description
Display Format: Showing 0.0000 for zero values
Location: Power Automate flow - Management fee section
```

**Resolution Implementation:**
- Modified Power Automate flow formatting logic
- Updated management fee section calculations
- Removed trailing zeros for zero or insignificant values
- Applied fix to both regular and overtime hour descriptions

**Testing Verification:**
- Confirmed fix in development environment
- Validated proper display formatting
- No trailing zeros for zero values

**Code Validation Status:**
✅ **VALIDATED** - Power Automate flow modifications confirmed in management fee processing

### 2. Data Processing Issues

#### 2.1 Invalid Date Handling in Input Files

**Issue ID:** I004  
**Date Identified:** 2025-06-18  
**Reported By:** Pratik Bedekar  
**Severity:** High  
**Status:** Resolved  

**Problem Description:**
Spreadsheet input files contained invalid dates (e.g., April 31st) and blank date fields, causing data retention issues and incorrect default date assignments.

**Technical Analysis:**
```
Invalid Date Examples:
- April 31st (non-existent date)
- Blank date cells in spreadsheets
- Empty rows with date fields

System Behavior:
- Assigns December 30, 1899 as default for blank dates
- Retains invalid date records in database
- Data deletion logic fails to handle default dates
```

**Root Cause:**
- SharePoint file processing accepts invalid date formats
- Logic App doesn't validate date fields before processing
- Database deletion logic doesn't account for default date values

**Resolution Implementation:**

1. **Logic App Updates:**
   - Added date validation before processing
   - Implemented logic to ignore rows with invalid dates
   - Enhanced error handling for date field processing

2. **Database Cleanup:**
   - Submitted request to delete existing invalid records
   - Identified records with December 30, 1899 default dates
   - Confirmed cleanup will not impact valid data

3. **Prevention Measures:**
   - Input validation at SharePoint level
   - Enhanced Logic App date parsing
   - Improved error logging for invalid dates

**Technical Implementation Details:**
```
Integration Points:
- SharePoint: File upload validation
- Logic App: Date field processing
- ETW Database: Record cleanup

Validation Logic:
- Check for valid date format
- Reject rows with invalid dates
- Log invalid date attempts
```

**Code Validation Status:**
✅ **VALIDATED** - Logic App date processing and SharePoint integration confirmed

### 3. System Integration Issues

#### 3.1 Revenue Code Visibility in Testing

**Issue ID:** I003  
**Date Identified:** 2025-06-12  
**Reported By:** Gayasuddin Gayasi  
**Severity:** Medium  
**Status:** Open - Investigation Required  

**Problem Description:**
Revenue codes are not visible in the invoice UI, making it difficult to validate that revenue calculations are correctly assigned to proper revenue codes during revenue share testing.

**Technical Analysis:**
```
Current Implementation:
- Revenue codes stored in threshold structures
- Codes assigned to different revenue share tiers
- UI displays revenue amounts but not associated codes
- Testing validation requires manual database queries
```

**Proposed Solutions:**

1. **API Enhancement Approach:**
   - Surface Revenue Code through API call
   - Display codes in statement frontend
   - Enable validation through UI

2. **Regression Testing Approach:**
   - Generate past invoices repeatedly
   - Compare results for consistency
   - Validate logic through reproducible outputs

3. **Database Seeding Approach:**
   - Populate TP stage database with test data
   - Enable direct database validation
   - Support comprehensive testing scenarios

**Impact Assessment:**
- **Testing Efficiency:** Currently requires database access for validation
- **User Experience:** Limited visibility into revenue code assignments
- **Quality Assurance:** Difficult to verify correct revenue code mapping

**Code Validation Status:**
✅ **VALIDATED** - Revenue code storage confirmed in [`RevenueShare.tsx`](Towne-Park-Billing-Source-Code/Towne Park Billing/src/components/RevenueShare/RevenueShare.tsx:227-233)
- Revenue codes stored in `structure.revenueCodes` array
- UI displays codes only when multiple threshold structures exist
- **CONFIRMED:** Revenue codes NOT visible on invoices as documented

**Next Steps:**
1. Business decision required on solution approach
2. Development effort estimation for each option
3. Testing strategy refinement based on chosen solution

## Resolution Patterns

### Common Issue Types

1. **Timing/Race Conditions**
   - Symptoms: Intermittent failures, zero values
   - Resolution: Add validation, implement retries
   - Prevention: Proper flow sequencing

2. **Data Validation Issues**
   - Symptoms: Invalid data processing, default values
   - Resolution: Input validation, error handling
   - Prevention: Frontend validation, data contracts

3. **Display/Formatting Issues**
   - Symptoms: Incorrect formatting, unnecessary data
   - Resolution: Flow logic updates, formatting rules
   - Prevention: UI/UX standards, testing protocols

### Best Practices for Issue Resolution

1. **Immediate Response:**
   - Document issue details immediately
   - Identify affected systems and users
   - Implement temporary workarounds if needed

2. **Root Cause Analysis:**
   - Trace issue through system components
   - Identify timing and dependency factors
   - Document technical implementation details

3. **Resolution Implementation:**
   - Test fixes in isolated environment
   - Validate against affected scenarios
   - Document code changes and validation

4. **Prevention Measures:**
   - Implement validation at input points
   - Add error handling and logging
   - Create monitoring for similar issues
