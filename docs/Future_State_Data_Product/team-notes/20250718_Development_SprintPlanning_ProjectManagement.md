- **Testing**: Comprehensive testing of all management agreement scenarios

### Secondary Development Focus: Statistics Actuals Implementation

#### Technical Scope and Estimation
**Story Points**: 5 points (estimated range: 3-5 points)  
**Technical Complexity**: Moderate with potential for complexity increase  
**Data Integration**: EDW integration for actual statistics data  
**UI Requirements**: Date-based input restrictions and data display

#### Technical Implementation Details

**Data Source Integration**:
- **Primary Data Source**: Revenue daily detail table
- **Query Requirements**: Statistics actuals data retrieval
- **Integration Method**: EDW API integration (not new ETL process)
- **Data Filtering**: Revenue category-based filtering for stat item determination

**Technical Architecture**:
```sql
-- Revenue Daily Detail Table Query Structure
-- Purpose: Retrieve statistics actuals data
-- Filtering: Can be filtered by revenue category or retrieve all
-- Output: Two columns per stat item - vehicle counts and external revenue
-- Integration: EDW API (existing infrastructure)
```

#### User Interface Requirements

**Date-Based Input Control**:
- **Functional Requirement**: Disable dates that have passed based on current date
- **Business Logic**: Past dates should be disabled regardless of actual data availability
- **Implementation**: Client-side date validation with server-side enforcement
- **User Experience**: Clear indication of disabled dates with appropriate messaging

**Data Display Requirements**:
- **Actual Data Display**: Show actual values when available from EDW
- **Fallback Behavior**: Handle cases where dates are disabled but actual data not yet available
- **Visual Indicators**: Clear distinction between actual and forecasted data
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of data retrieval failures

#### Development Team Assessment

**Initial Complexity Assessment** (Andrew Scheuer): "Well, I'm just speaking from like my own knowledge. This involves doing an ETL if I understand correctly or getting the data flow from EDW or no?"

**Technical Clarification** (Cesar Figueroa): "No, that's that's change. That's look like a change in the ADW API. It's like I think that we already."

**Final Estimation** (Christopher Thompson): "Yeah, I mean, I think A5 at most for this if we anything wonky, but I'm kind of flip flop between 3:00 and 5:00 if we have. The this has the actual query. We need to get the statistics actuals data right somewhere."

#### Implementation Risk Assessment
- **Technical Risk**: Moderate - Existing EDW infrastructure reduces implementation risk
- **Data Risk**: Low - Leverages existing revenue daily detail table
- **Integration Risk**: Low - Uses existing API rather than new ETL process
- **Timeline Risk**: Low - Well-defined scope with clear technical approach

## Technical Implementation Strategy
