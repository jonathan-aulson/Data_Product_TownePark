# AI Development Tools Configuration Guide

## Document Overview

This guide provides comprehensive configuration instructions for AI development tools used by the Towne Park development team. Based on the configuration discussion from Sprint 28 planning session, this document covers Root Code setup, model selection, API configuration, and profile management for optimal AI-assisted development workflows.

## Executive Summary

AI development tools enhance developer productivity through intelligent code assistance, automated task breakdown, and context-aware suggestions. Proper configuration ensures optimal performance, cost management, and seamless integration with existing development workflows. This guide establishes standardized configurations and best practices for the development team.

## Tool Configuration Framework

### 1. Root Code (Cline) Configuration

├── Model Selector (adjacent to mode)
├── API Provider Selection (top of model menu)
├── Profile Management (plus icon)
└── Configuration Save (named profiles)
```

**Step-by-Step Model Configuration:**
1. **Access Model Menu**
   - Locate model selector at bottom of Root Code interface
   - Click to open model selection dropdown

2. **Select API Provider**
   - Choose from available providers at top of menu
   - Options include: Anthropic, OpenAI, Allata, OpenRouter

3. **Choose Specific Model**
   - Select model version appropriate for task
   - Consider cost and capability trade-offs

4. **Save Configuration**
   - Click plus (+) icon to save configuration
   - Provide descriptive name for easy identification

#### 1.3 API Key Configuration

**Allata Internal API Setup:**
```

- OpenAI (GPT models)
- OpenRouter (multiple model access)

Configuration Requirements:
- Valid API key from provider
- Appropriate billing setup
- Rate limit awareness
```

**API Key Security Best Practices:**
- Store API keys in secure environment variables
- Never commit API keys to version control
- Use team-shared keys for consistent billing
- Regularly rotate API keys for security

### 2. Model Profile Management

#### 2.1 Profile Creation and Naming

**Profile Naming Convention:**
```
Format: [Model]_[Version]_[Provider]
Examples:
- "GPT_4.1_Allata" - GPT-4.1 using Allata API
- "GPT_4.1_OpenRouter" - GPT-4.1 using OpenRouter credits
- "Claude_3.5_Anthropic" - Claude 3.5 using direct Anthropic API
- "GPT_4o_OpenAI" - GPT-4o using OpenAI API
```

**Profile Configuration Process:**
1. **Select Base Configuration**
   - Choose API provider from dropdown
   - Select specific model version
   - Configure any model-specific parameters

2. **Save Named Profile**
   - Click plus (+) icon in model menu
   - Enter descriptive profile name
   - Confirm configuration save

3. **Verify Profile Access**
   - Profile appears in saved configurations list
   - Quick switching between profiles enabled
   - Configuration persists across VS Code sessions

#### 2.2 Profile Optimization Strategies

**Cost-Optimized Profiles:**
```
Development Tasks:
- Code completion: Use faster, cheaper models
- Code review: Use higher-capability models

- Batch processing: Cost-effective models
- Real-time assistance: Low-latency models
```

**Team Standardization:**
```
Shared Profile Standards:
- Consistent naming conventions
- Standardized model selections
- Shared API key management
- Common configuration templates
```

### 3. Development Workflow Integration
