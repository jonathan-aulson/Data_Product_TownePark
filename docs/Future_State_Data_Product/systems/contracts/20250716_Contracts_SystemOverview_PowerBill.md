# Contract Management System Overview - PowerBill Platform

## Executive Summary

The Contract Management System within Towne Park's PowerBill platform serves as the foundational component for all billing operations, managing over 650 active contracts across diverse service arrangements. This system orchestrates contract types, billing structures, escalation mechanisms, and payment terms to ensure accurate revenue recognition and customer billing.

## System Architecture

### Core Components

#### Contract Repository
- **Primary Function**: Centralized storage and management of all customer contracts
- **Data Volume**: 653+ active contracts as of May 2025
- **Key Identifiers**: 
  - Contract ID (`bs_contractid`)
  - Customer Site Foreign Key (`bs_customersitefk`)
  - Contract Type Classifications

#### Rate Management Engine
- **Billing Type Processing**: 
  - [`126840000`](../../business-rules/contracts/billing-types.md:1) - Advanced billing
  - [`126840001`](../../business-rules/contracts/billing-types.md:2) - Arrears billing
- **Contract Type Support**:
  - Fixed Fee arrangements
  - Per Labor Hour (PLH) billing
  - Revenue Share models
  - Management Agreements
  - Hybrid combinations

#### Escalation Engine
- **Automatic Rate Adjustments**: Processes annual escalations based on:
  - Fixed percentage increases (typically 3-5%)
  - Consumer Price Index (CPI) adjustments
  - Employment Cost Index (ECI) calculations
  - Greater-of formulas (e.g., "greater of 3% or CPI")

#### Payment Terms Management
- **Standard Terms**: 
  - Due in 15/30/45/60 days
  - Due by specific dates (1st, 15th, 20th of month)
  - Due on receipt
- **Special Arrangements**: Mid-month advance billing, deposited revenue handling

## Contract Types and Billing Models

### Fixed Fee Contracts
- **Structure**: Predetermined monthly/annual fees
- **Escalation**: Typically 3-5% annual increases
- **Use Cases**: Management agreements, base service fees
- **Example**: Monthly management fee with annual CPI adjustment

### Per Labor Hour (PLH) Contracts
- **Structure**: Hourly billing for actual services provided
- **Rate Types**: 
  - Standard hourly rates
  - Overtime multipliers (1.5x standard rate)
  - Specialized role rates (Manager, GSC, GSA, Cashier)
- **Escalation**: Annual rate increases based on ECI or fixed percentages
- **Reporting**: Requires hours backup documentation

### Revenue Share Agreements
- **Structure**: Percentage-based revenue sharing
- **Thresholds**: Validation thresholds (typically 2-10% of revenue)
- **Revenue Types**: 
  - Parking revenue
  - Valet services
  - Bell services
- **Collection Models**: Client-collected vs. Towne Park-collected

### Management Agreements
- **Components**:
  - Base management fees
  - Profit sharing arrangements
  - Support services fees
  - Insurance and expense reimbursements
- **Escalation**: Annual increases on management fees and support services

## Business Rules and Validation

### Contract Validation Rules
1. **Deviation Thresholds**: Standard 10% deviation allowance with $2,500 cap
2. **Escalation Timing**: Specific anniversary dates for rate increases
3. **Payment Terms**: Standardized terms based on contract type
4. **Supporting Documentation**: Required backup reports by contract type

### Rate Escalation Patterns
- **Annual Increases**: Processed on contract anniversary dates
- **Index-Based**: CPI and ECI calculations for market adjustments
- **Hybrid Models**: "Greater of" formulas ensuring minimum increases
- **Special Circumstances**: Custom escalation schedules for specific clients

## Integration Points

### PowerBill Platform Integration
- **Billing Engine**: Contract data feeds automated invoice generation
- **Rate Tables**: Dynamic rate updates based on escalation schedules
- **Customer Management**: Links to customer site directory
- **Reporting System**: Provides data for financial and operational reports

### External System Connections
- **Customer Sites System**: References site-specific information
- **Financial Reporting**: Feeds revenue recognition and forecasting
- **Operational Systems**: Supports hours tracking and service delivery

## Data Quality and Governance

### Data Validation
- **Contract Completeness**: All required fields populated
- **Rate Consistency**: Validation against approved rate schedules
- **Escalation Accuracy**: Automated calculation verification
- **Payment Terms**: Standardization across contract types

### Audit and Compliance
- **Change Tracking**: Complete audit trail for contract modifications
- **Approval Workflows**: Multi-level approval for rate changes
- **Documentation Requirements**: Supporting documentation for all contract terms
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Adherence to billing and revenue recognition standards

## Performance Metrics
