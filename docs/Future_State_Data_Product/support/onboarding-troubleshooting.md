# Onboarding Troubleshooting

## Purpose

This document provides comprehensive troubleshooting guidance for customer site onboarding processes, helping support teams quickly identify, diagnose, and resolve common onboarding issues to ensure smooth customer transitions.

## Troubleshooting Framework

### Problem Resolution Methodology
1. **Issue Identification**: Clearly identify and categorize the problem
2. **Information Gathering**: Collect relevant information and context
3. **Root Cause Analysis**: Determine the underlying cause of the issue
4. **Solution Development**: Develop appropriate resolution strategies
5. **Implementation**: Execute the resolution plan
