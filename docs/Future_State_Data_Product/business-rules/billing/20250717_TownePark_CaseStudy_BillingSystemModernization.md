# Towne Park Billing System Modernization - Comprehensive Case Study

## 🎯 Executive Summary

Towne Park, a $1 billion leader in turnkey parking services for hospitality and healthcare industries, successfully transformed their manual, Excel-based billing and invoicing processes into a modern, automated cloud-based solution. This comprehensive modernization project, delivered by Allata, eliminated operational bottlenecks, reduced general ledger closing time from half the month to a fraction of that time, and positioned Towne Park for scalable growth across their 700+ customer sites.

## 🏢 Client Profile

### **Company Overview**
- **Client Name**: Towne Park
- **Industry**: Parking Services (Turnkey, Hospitality & Healthcare customers)
- **Revenue**: $1 Billion annually
- **Scale**: Over 700 customer sites, including high-profile clients like Disneyland
- **Headquarters**: Plymouth Meeting, PA (Philadelphia)
- **Business Model**: Turnkey parking services (valet) for Hospitality & Healthcare industry

### **Key Stakeholders**
- **Primary Contact**: Amy Sowells (asowells@townepark.com) - Sr. Finance Manager
- **Executive Leadership**:
  - Michael Morgioni - CFO
  - Brian LaChapelle - SVP Finance & Corp Controller
  - Jim Boyer - Sr. Director Business & Performance Analytics

### **Organizational Scale**
- **Total Customer Sites**: 771 (currently in acquisition mode)
- **Operational Staff**:
  - ~475 Account Managers
  - ~130 Associate Managers
  - ~75 District Managers
  - ~35 Area/Regional Managers
  - ~7 Regional VPs
- **Finance Team**: ~16 Finance Users
- **Billing Team**: ~4 Core Users

## 🚨 Business Challenge

### **Critical Pain Points**

#### **1. Manual, Time-Consuming Processes**
The Excel-based system required account managers at over 700 sites to manually collect and submit daily and monthly data, which was then processed manually for invoicing. This process consumed significant time and resources, delaying financial reporting and general ledger closing by nearly half the month.

#### **2. Error-Prone Data Handling**
The manual nature of data collection and processing increased the risk of errors, leading to potential inaccuracies in billing and financial reporting that could result in revenue leakage and customer disputes.

#### **3. Lack of Scalability**
As Towne Park expanded operations, the Excel-based system struggled to keep up with growing data volume and contract complexity, creating operational inefficiencies that threatened their ability to serve high-profile clients like Disneyland.

#### **4. Limited Internal Development Resources**
Towne Park lacked an internal development team, making it difficult to maintain or enhance existing processes or implement new solutions without external support.

#### **5. Fragmented Data Management**
The use of spreadsheets for data consolidation and invoice creation created a fragmented system that lacked integration, with no "source of truth" for contract details outside of a repository of PDFs that were not easily accessible.

### **Industry Context**

#### **Digital Transformation Pressures**
- **Hospitality and Healthcare Modernization**: Industries increasingly adopting digital solutions to improve operational efficiency and customer experience
- **Automation Demand**: Companies leveraging low-code platforms to reduce manual effort, improve accuracy, and accelerate processes
- **Cloud Adoption**: Shift to cloud-based solutions enabling businesses to scale operations, enhance data security, and improve accessibility
- **Data-Driven Decision Making**: Organizations prioritizing data integration and analytics to gain insights and drive strategic decisions

#### **Competitive Landscape**
Towne Park operates in a competitive market where efficiency, accuracy, and scalability are critical differentiators. High-profile clients like Disneyland expect seamless operations and timely, accurate billing. Competitors offering more modern, automated solutions posed a threat to Towne Park's market position.
