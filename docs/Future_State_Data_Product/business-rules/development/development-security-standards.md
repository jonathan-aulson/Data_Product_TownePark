# Development Security Standards

## Overview

This document establishes comprehensive security standards for all development activities within the Towne Park system. These standards ensure secure coding practices, protect sensitive data, and maintain system integrity throughout the development lifecycle.

## Core Security Principles

### Secure by Design
- Security considerations must be integrated from the initial design phase
- All new features require security impact assessment
- Default configurations must be secure
- Principle of least privilege applies to all system access

### Defense in Depth
- Multiple layers of security controls
- No single point of failure in security architecture
- Redundant security measures for critical components
- Continuous monitoring and validation

## Code Security Standards

### Secure Coding Practices

#### Input Validation
- **Rule**: All user inputs must be validated and sanitized
- **Implementation**: Use parameterized queries, input validation libraries
- **Validation**: Code review must verify input handling
- **Examples**: SQL injection prevention, XSS protection

#### Authentication and Authorization
- **Rule**: All API endpoints require proper authentication
- **Implementation**: OAuth 2.0, JWT tokens, role-based access control
- **Validation**: Security testing of authentication flows
- **Examples**: User session management, API key validation

#### Data Protection
- **Rule**: Sensitive data must be encrypted in transit and at rest
- **Implementation**: TLS 1.3, AES-256 encryption, secure key management
- **Validation**: Encryption verification in code review
- **Examples**: Database encryption, API communication security

### Code Review Security Requirements

#### Security Checklist
- [ ] Input validation implemented for all user inputs
- [ ] Authentication and authorization properly configured
- [ ] Sensitive data handling follows encryption standards
- [ ] Error handling doesn't expose sensitive information
- [ ] Logging includes security events without sensitive data
- [ ] Dependencies are up-to-date and vulnerability-free

#### Security Review Process
1. **Automated Security Scanning**: Static analysis tools integration
2. **Manual Security Review**: Security-focused code review
3. **Penetration Testing**: Security testing for critical features
4. **Vulnerability Assessment**: Regular security assessments

## Development Environment Security

### Access Control
- **Development Environment Access**: Multi-factor authentication required
- **Code Repository Access**: Role-based permissions
- **Production Access**: Strictly controlled and logged
- **Secrets Management**: No hardcoded credentials

### Secure Development Lifecycle

#### Planning Phase
- Security requirements definition
- Threat modeling for new features
- Security architecture review
- Risk assessment documentation

#### Development Phase
- Secure coding standards compliance
- Security-focused unit testing
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Code quality and security metrics

#### Testing Phase
- Security testing integration
- Penetration testing for critical features
- Vulnerability assessment
- Security regression testing

#### Deployment Phase
- Security configuration validation
- Production security monitoring
- Incident response procedures
- Security audit logging

## AI Development Security

### AI Tool Usage Security
- **Rule**: AI tools must not process sensitive production data
- **Implementation**: Data anonymization, secure AI environments
- **Validation**: AI tool usage audit and monitoring
- **Examples**: Code generation tools, automated testing

### AI-Generated Code Security
- **Rule**: All AI-generated code requires security review
- **Implementation**: Enhanced code review for AI-generated content
- **Validation**: Security testing of AI-generated components
- **Examples**: Automated code suggestions, generated test cases

## Data Security Standards

### Sensitive Data Classification
- **Level 1 - Public**: No special handling required
- **Level 2 - Internal**: Access control and audit logging
- **Level 3 - Confidential**: Encryption and restricted access
- **Level 4 - Restricted**: Maximum security controls

### Data Handling Requirements
- **Storage**: Encrypted storage for Level 3+ data
- **Transmission**: TLS encryption for all data transmission
- **Processing**: Secure processing environments
- **Disposal**: Secure data deletion procedures

## Security Monitoring and Incident Response

### Security Monitoring
- **Code Repository Monitoring**: Unauthorized access detection
- **Development Environment Monitoring**: Anomaly detection
- **Dependency Monitoring**: Vulnerability tracking
- **Access Monitoring**: Privileged access logging

### Incident Response
- **Security Incident Classification**: Severity levels and response procedures
- **Escalation Procedures**: Security team notification protocols
- **Documentation Requirements**: Incident tracking and lessons learned
- **Recovery Procedures**: System restoration and validation

## Compliance and Audit

### Compliance Requirements
- **Industry Standards**: SOC 2, ISO 27001 compliance
- **Regulatory Requirements**: Data protection regulations
- **Internal Policies**: Corporate security policies
- **Third-Party Requirements**: Vendor security standards

### Audit Procedures
- **Regular Security Audits**: Quarterly security assessments
- **Code Security Audits**: Security-focused code reviews
- **Access Audits**: Privilege and access reviews
- **Compliance Audits**: Regulatory compliance verification

## Training and Awareness

### Security Training Requirements
- **New Developer Onboarding**: Security fundamentals training
- **Ongoing Training**: Regular security updates and best practices
- **Specialized Training**: Role-specific security training
- **Certification Requirements**: Security certification maintenance

### Security Awareness
- **Security Communications**: Regular security updates
- **Threat Intelligence**: Current threat landscape awareness
- **Best Practices Sharing**: Security knowledge sharing
- **Incident Learning**: Lessons learned from security incidents
