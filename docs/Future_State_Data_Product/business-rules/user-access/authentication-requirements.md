# Authentication Requirements

## Overview

This document establishes comprehensive authentication requirements for user identity verification across all Towne Park systems. These requirements ensure secure and reliable user authentication while maintaining usability and compliance with security standards.

## Core Authentication Principles

### Identity Verification
- Reliable verification of user identity before granting access
- Multi-factor authentication for enhanced security
- Strong authentication mechanisms for sensitive systems
- Continuous authentication monitoring and validation

### Security Standards
- Industry-standard authentication protocols and methods
- Protection against common authentication attacks
- Secure credential storage and transmission
- Regular security assessments and updates

### User Experience
- Seamless authentication experience for legitimate users
- Single sign-on (SSO) capabilities where appropriate
- Self-service password management capabilities
- Clear authentication error messages and guidance

### Compliance
- Adherence to regulatory authentication requirements
- Industry best practices for authentication security
- Audit trails for authentication events
- Regular compliance assessments and reporting

## Authentication Methods

### Primary Authentication Factors

#### Username and Password
- **Requirement**: Strong password policies enforced
- **Implementation**: Minimum 12 characters with complexity requirements
- **Security**: Password hashing using industry-standard algorithms
- **Management**: Self-service password reset capabilities

#### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- **Requirement**: Required for all administrative and sensitive system access
- **Implementation**: SMS, email, or authenticator app-based verification
- **Security**: Time-based one-time passwords (TOTP) or push notifications
- **Management**: User enrollment and device management procedures

#### Single Sign-On (SSO)
- **Requirement**: Implemented for integrated system access
- **Implementation**: SAML 2.0 or OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect protocols
- **Security**: Centralized authentication with federated identity management
- **Management**: Centralized user provisioning and deprovisioning

### Biometric Authentication
- **Requirement**: Optional for high-security environments
- **Implementation**: Fingerprint, facial recognition, or voice recognition
- **Security**: Biometric data encrypted and stored securely
- **Management**: Biometric enrollment and template management

## Authentication Rules

### Password Requirements
- **Rule AUTH-001**: Minimum password length of 12 characters
- **Rule AUTH-002**: Password must contain uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
- **Rule AUTH-003**: Password cannot contain dictionary words or personal information
- **Rule AUTH-004**: Password history of 12 previous passwords maintained
- **Rule AUTH-005**: Password expiration every 90 days for standard users
- **Rule AUTH-006**: Password expiration every 60 days for privileged users

### Account Security Rules
- **Rule AUTH-007**: Account lockout after 5 failed authentication attempts
- **Rule AUTH-008**: Account lockout duration of 30 minutes
- **Rule AUTH-009**: Automatic account unlock after lockout period
- **Rule AUTH-010**: Manual account unlock requires administrator approval
- **Rule AUTH-011**: Dormant accounts disabled after 90 days of inactivity
- **Rule AUTH-012**: Terminated user accounts disabled immediately

### Multi-Factor Authentication Rules
- **Rule AUTH-013**: MFA required for all administrative accounts
- **Rule AUTH-014**: MFA required for remote access to sensitive systems
- **Rule AUTH-015**: MFA required for privileged operations
- **Rule AUTH-016**: MFA bypass requires emergency approval and audit logging
- **Rule AUTH-017**: MFA device registration requires identity verification
- **Rule AUTH-018**: Lost MFA devices require re-enrollment process

### Session Management Rules
- **Rule AUTH-019**: Session timeout after 30 minutes of inactivity
- **Rule AUTH-020**: Absolute session timeout after 8 hours
- **Rule AUTH-021**: Concurrent session limits based on user role
- **Rule AUTH-022**: Session invalidation upon password change
- **Rule AUTH-023**: Secure session token generation and management
- **Rule AUTH-024**: Session data encrypted during transmission
