# Payroll Data Display Business Rules

## Purpose

This document defines the business rules governing how payroll data is displayed, formatted, and presented within the Towne Park forecasting system. These rules ensure consistent, accurate, and user-friendly presentation of payroll information across all system interfaces.

## Core Display Rules

### Data Granularity Rules

#### BR-PD-001: Time Period Granularity
- **Rule**: Payroll data must be displayable at multiple time granularities
- **Supported Granularities**:
  - Daily: Individual day payroll costs and hours
  - Weekly: 7-day aggregated payroll summaries
  - Monthly: Calendar month payroll totals
  - Quarterly: 3-month aggregated payroll data
- **Business Justification**: Different user roles require different levels of detail for operational vs. strategic decision-making
- **Implementation**: System must support dynamic aggregation based on user selection

#### BR-PD-002: Job Code Breakdown
- **Rule**: Payroll data must be breakable down by individual job codes
- **Required Job Code Categories**:
  - Valet Attendant
  - Bell Staff
  - Cashier
  - Supervisor
  - Manager
  - Other/Miscellaneous
- **Business Justification**: Enables detailed labor cost analysis and staffing optimization
- **Implementation**: Database queries must support job code filtering and grouping

### Data Formatting Rules

#### BR-PD-003: Currency Display Standards
- **Rule**: All payroll monetary values must follow consistent currency formatting
- **Format Requirements**:
  - Currency symbol: $ (USD)
  - Decimal places: 2 (e.g., $1,234.56)
  - Thousands separator: Comma (,)
  - Negative values: Parentheses format ($1,234.56)
- **Business Justification**: Ensures consistent financial data presentation across all interfaces
- **Implementation**: Apply formatting at presentation layer, not data storage layer

#### BR-PD-004: Hours Display Standards
- **Rule**: Labor hours must be displayed with consistent precision and formatting
- **Format Requirements**:
  - Decimal places: 2 (e.g., 40.25 hours)
  - Unit label: "hours" or "hrs" abbreviation
  - Overtime distinction: Separate display for regular vs. overtime hours
- **Business Justification**: Provides clear visibility into labor utilization and overtime costs
- **Implementation**: Calculate and display regular/overtime hours separately

### User Interface Rules

#### BR-PD-005: Data Hierarchy Display
- **Rule**: Payroll data must be presented in logical hierarchical groupings
- **Hierarchy Structure**:
  1. Site Level (highest)
  2. Time Period (year/month/week/day)
  3. Job Code Category
  4. Individual Employee (when applicable)
- **Business Justification**: Enables users to drill down from summary to detail as needed
- **Implementation**: Expandable/collapsible interface elements

#### BR-PD-006: Variance Highlighting
- **Rule**: Significant variances from budget or forecast must be visually highlighted
- **Variance Thresholds**:
  - High variance: >15% difference (red highlighting)
  - Medium variance: 5-15% difference (yellow highlighting)
  - Low variance: <5% difference (green highlighting)
- **Business Justification**: Draws attention to areas requiring management focus
- **Implementation**: Color-coded backgrounds or text with variance percentage display

## Data Access Rules

### Security and Permissions

#### BR-PD-007: Role-Based Data Access
- **Rule**: Payroll data visibility must be restricted based on user roles and site assignments
- **Access Levels**:
  - Account Manager: Assigned sites only, summary level
  - District Manager: District sites, detailed level
  - Payroll Administrator: All sites, full detail including employee names
  - System Administrator: All sites, all data including audit trails
- **Business Justification**: Protects sensitive payroll information while enabling necessary business functions
- **Implementation**: Database-level security with role-based filtering

#### BR-PD-008: Historical Data Retention
- **Rule**: Payroll display must support historical data access with appropriate retention periods
- **Retention Periods**:
  - Current year: Full detail available
  - Previous 2 years: Summary data available
  - Older than 3 years: Archive access only (special permission required)
- **Business Justification**: Balances operational needs with data storage efficiency
- **Implementation**: Tiered data storage with automated archiving

## Performance Rules

### Response Time Requirements

#### BR-PD-009: Display Performance Standards
- **Rule**: Payroll data displays must meet minimum performance requirements
- **Performance Targets**:
  - Summary views: <2 seconds load time
  - Detailed views: <5 seconds load time
  - Large dataset exports: <30 seconds processing time
- **Business Justification**: Ensures productive user experience and system usability
- **Implementation**: Optimized queries, caching, and progressive loading

#### BR-PD-010: Data Refresh Frequency
- **Rule**: Payroll data displays must show current data within acceptable refresh intervals
- **Refresh Requirements**:
  - Real-time data: Current day payroll (hourly refresh)
  - Near real-time: Previous day data (daily refresh)
  - Batch data: Historical periods (weekly refresh)
- **Business Justification**: Provides timely information for operational decision-making
- **Implementation**: Scheduled data synchronization with source systems

## Validation Rules

### Data Quality Display

#### BR-PD-011: Data Quality Indicators
- **Rule**: Payroll displays must include data quality indicators when applicable
- **Quality Indicators**:
  - Complete: All expected data present (green checkmark)
  - Partial: Some data missing (yellow warning)
  - Incomplete: Significant data gaps (red alert)
  - Estimated: Projected or calculated values (blue info icon)
- **Business Justification**: Enables users to assess data reliability for decision-making
- **Implementation**: Data quality scoring with visual indicators

#### BR-PD-012: Exception Highlighting
- **Rule**: Unusual payroll patterns or anomalies must be highlighted for user attention
- **Exception Types**:
  - Overtime spikes: >20% increase from previous period
  - Missing timesheet data: Expected but not received
  - Rate changes: Hourly rate modifications
  - New job codes: Previously unseen job classifications
- **Business Justification**: Helps identify potential data issues or operational changes
- **Implementation**: Automated anomaly detection with visual alerts

## Integration Rules

### System Connectivity

#### BR-PD-013: Source System Integration
- **Rule**: Payroll displays must clearly indicate data source and last update time
- **Source Identification**:
  - Legion timekeeping system: Primary source for hours
  - Payroll system: Primary source for rates and costs
  - Manual adjustments: User-entered modifications
  - Calculated values: System-derived totals
- **Business Justification**: Provides transparency and traceability for payroll data
- **Implementation**: Metadata tracking with source attribution

#### BR-PD-014: Real-time vs. Batch Data Distinction
- **Rule**: Users must be able to distinguish between real-time and batch-processed payroll data
- **Distinction Methods**:
  - Timestamp display: Last update time shown
  - Data freshness indicators: Real-time, hourly, daily, etc.
  - Processing status: "Live", "Processing", "Complete"
- **Business Justification**: Helps users understand data currency for decision-making
- **Implementation**: Status indicators with hover-over details

## Compliance Rules

### Audit and Reporting

#### BR-PD-015: Audit Trail Requirements
- **Rule**: All payroll data access and modifications must be logged for audit purposes
- **Audit Information**:
  - User identification: Who accessed the data
  - Timestamp: When the access occurred
  - Data scope: What data was viewed or modified
  - Actions taken: View, export, modify, etc.
- **Business Justification**: Ensures compliance with payroll data security requirements
- **Implementation**: Comprehensive logging with audit report generation

#### BR-PD-016: Export and Reporting Standards
- **Rule**: Payroll data exports must maintain formatting and include necessary metadata
- **Export Requirements**:
  - Format options: Excel, CSV, PDF
  - Metadata inclusion: Export date, user, data range, filters applied
  - Data integrity: Checksums or validation for large exports
- **Business Justification**: Ensures exported data maintains accuracy and traceability
- **Implementation**: Standardized export templates with validation
