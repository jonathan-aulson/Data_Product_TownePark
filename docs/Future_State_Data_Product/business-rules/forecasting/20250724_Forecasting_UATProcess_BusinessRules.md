# Forecasting UAT Process Business Rules

## Overview

This document defines comprehensive business rules governing User Acceptance Testing (UAT) processes for forecasting system features, including validation criteria, approval workflows, test execution standards, and quality assurance requirements.

## Rule Definitions

### Rule UAT-001: UAT Scope Definition
**Rule Name**: UAT Scope Definition  
**Description**: All forecasting system features must undergo UAT before production deployment  
**Applies To**: All forecasting features, enhancements, and integrations  
**Calculation Formula**: UAT Coverage = (Features Tested / Total Features) × 100, Target ≥ 100%  
**Examples**: 
- New forecasting calculation logic requires UAT
- UI changes to forecasting displays require UAT
- Integration updates with external systems require UAT
**Source**: Quality Assurance Standards v2.1, approved 2025-06-15  
**Implementation**: UAT tracking system with feature coverage metrics  
**Edge Cases**: 
- Emergency hotfixes may have abbreviated UAT with post-deployment validation
- Configuration-only changes require UAT validation of affected functionality

### Rule UAT-002: UAT Participant Requirements
**Rule Name**: UAT Participant Requirements  
**Description**: UAT must include representative users from each affected role  
**Applies To**: All UAT sessions for forecasting features  
**Calculation Formula**: Role Coverage = (Roles Represented / Affected Roles) × 100, Target ≥ 100%  
**Examples**:
- Account Manager features require Account Manager participation
- District Manager workflows require District Manager participation
- Cross-role features require multi-role participation
**Source**: UAT Standards Document v1.3, approved 2025-05-20  
**Implementation**: UAT participant tracking with role validation  
**Edge Cases**: 
- If primary role unavailable, designated backup with equivalent permissions may participate
- Training may be provided to participants unfamiliar with new features

### Rule UAT-003: Test Case Coverage Requirements
**Rule Name**: Test Case Coverage Requirements  
**Description**: UAT test cases must cover all user scenarios and business workflows  
**Applies To**: All forecasting UAT test suites  
**Calculation Formula**: Scenario Coverage = (Scenarios Tested / Total Scenarios) × 100, Target ≥ 95%  
**Examples**:
- Happy path scenarios for standard forecasting workflows
- Error handling scenarios for invalid data entry
- Edge case scenarios for boundary conditions
**Source**: Test Case Standards v2.0, approved 2025-04-10  
**Implementation**: Test case management system with traceability matrix  
**Edge Cases**: 
- Some edge cases may be deferred if business impact is minimal
- New scenarios discovered during UAT must be documented and tested

### Rule UAT-004: Data Validation Requirements
**Rule Name**: Data Validation Requirements  
**Description**: UAT must validate data accuracy and consistency across all forecasting modules  
**Applies To**: All forecasting data processing and display features  
**Calculation Formula**: Data Accuracy = (Correct Data Points / Total Data Points) × 100, Target ≥ 99.5%  
**Examples**:
- Forecasting calculations produce expected results
- Data displays show accurate historical information
- Integration data matches source system values
**Source**: Data Quality Standards v1.5, approved 2025-03-25  
**Implementation**: Automated data validation checks with manual verification  
**Edge Cases**: 
- Minor rounding differences (<0.01%) may be acceptable
- Data timing differences due to refresh schedules must be documented

### Rule UAT-005: Performance Validation Requirements
**Rule Name**: Performance Validation Requirements  
**Description**: UAT must validate system performance meets defined standards  
**Applies To**: All forecasting system features with performance requirements  
**Calculation Formula**: Performance Compliance = (Metrics Meeting Standards / Total Metrics) × 100, Target ≥ 95%  
**Examples**:
- Page load times <5 seconds for forecasting displays
- Report generation <30 seconds for standard reports
- Data refresh operations <10 seconds for typical datasets
**Source**: Performance Standards v1.2, approved 2025-02-15  
**Implementation**: Performance monitoring tools with automated threshold checking  
**Edge Cases**: 
- Performance may vary based on data volume and system load
- Acceptable degradation during peak usage periods must be defined

### Rule UAT-006: UAT Approval Criteria
**Rule Name**: UAT Approval Criteria  
**Description**: UAT approval requires meeting all defined success criteria  
**Applies To**: All forecasting UAT sessions  
**Calculation Formula**: Approval Score = (Criteria Met / Total Criteria) × 100, Target = 100%  
**Examples**:
- All critical test cases pass
- No blocking defects identified
- Performance standards met
- User satisfaction score ≥4.0/5.0
**Source**: UAT Approval Standards v1.1, approved 2025-01-30  
**Implementation**: UAT approval workflow with criteria checklist  
**Edge Cases**: 
- Minor non-blocking issues may be accepted with mitigation plans
- Conditional approval may be granted with specific remediation requirements

### Rule UAT-007: Defect Classification and Resolution
**Rule Name**: Defect Classification and Resolution  
**Description**: UAT defects must be classified and resolved according to severity levels  
**Applies To**: All defects identified during forecasting UAT  
**Calculation Formula**: Resolution Compliance = (Defects Resolved per SLA / Total Defects) × 100, Target ≥ 95%  
**Examples**:
- Critical defects: Resolution within 24 hours
- High defects: Resolution within 72 hours
- Medium defects: Resolution within 1 week
- Low defects: Resolution within 2 weeks
**Source**: Defect Management Standards v2.2, approved 2025-06-01  
**Implementation**: Defect tracking system with automated SLA monitoring  
**Edge Cases**: 
- Complex defects may require extended resolution timeframes with stakeholder approval
- Workarounds may be acceptable for non-critical defects

### Rule UAT-008: Documentation Requirements
**Rule Name**: Documentation Requirements  
**Description**: UAT must produce comprehensive documentation of test results and findings  
**Applies To**: All forecasting UAT activities  
**Calculation Formula**: Documentation Completeness = (Required Documents / Total Documents) × 100, Target = 100%  
**Examples**:
- Test execution reports with pass/fail status
- Defect reports with detailed descriptions
- Performance test results with metrics
- User feedback summaries with recommendations
**Source**: Documentation Standards v1.4, approved 2025-05-10  
**Implementation**: Document management system with template compliance checking  
**Edge Cases**: 
- Emergency UAT may have abbreviated documentation with post-completion updates
- Confidential findings may require restricted access documentation
