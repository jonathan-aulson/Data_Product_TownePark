# Forecasting - Job Code Management Business Rules

## Purpose

This document defines the comprehensive business rules governing the management of job codes and job groups within the forecasting system. These rules ensure consistent job classification, proper wage assignment, accurate forecasting calculations, and standardized workforce management across all customer sites.

## Scope and Applicability

### System Scope
- **Primary System**: Towne Park Forecasting System
- **Integration Systems**: Payroll systems, HR systems, Customer site management
- **Data Scope**: All job codes, job groups, and related workforce data
- **Process Scope**: Job code creation, modification, assignment, validation, and retirement

### Business Domain Coverage
- Job code structure and naming conventions
- Job group organization and hierarchy
- Site assignment and customer mapping
- Wage rate management and validation
- Forecasting calculation requirements
- Compliance and audit requirements

## Core Business Rules

### BR-JC-001: Job Code Structure and Format Requirements

**Rule Statement**: All job codes must conform to established structural and format standards to ensure consistency and system compatibility.

**Business Justification**: Standardized job code structure enables accurate data processing, consistent reporting, and seamless integration with payroll and HR systems.

**Rule Details**:
- **Format Pattern**: Job codes must follow the pattern `[A-Z]{2,6}[0-9]{0,3}`
- **Length Requirements**: Minimum 2 characters, maximum 9 characters total
- **Character Set**: Uppercase letters followed by optional numeric suffix
- **Naming Convention**: Descriptive abbreviation reflecting job function
- **Uniqueness**: Job codes must be unique across the entire system

**Format Examples**:
- Valid: `PARK`, `CASH01`, `MAINT`, `SUPV02`, `ATTEND`
- Invalid: `park`, `Cash-01`, `M@INT`, `SUPERVISOR_LEVEL_2`

**Validation Logic**:
```
IF job_code MATCHES /^[A-Z]{2,6}[0-9]{0,3}$/ AND length <= 9 THEN
    PASS format validation
ELSE
    FAIL with error "Invalid job code format"
```

**Error Handling**: Job codes failing format validation are rejected and flagged for correction before system entry.

**Exceptions**: Legacy job codes may retain existing format until next major system update, but new codes must comply.

### BR-JC-002: Job Code Naming and Description Standards

**Rule Statement**: Job codes must have clear, descriptive names and comprehensive descriptions that accurately reflect job functions and responsibilities.

**Business Justification**: Clear naming and descriptions ensure proper job classification, accurate wage assignment, and effective workforce planning.

- **Job Description**: 10-500 characters, detailed explanation of role and responsibilities
- **Department Assignment**: Must be assigned to valid department
- **Job Category**: Must be classified into predefined job categories

**Naming Standards**:
- Use title case for job names (e.g., "Parking Attendant", "Cashier")
- Avoid abbreviations in job names unless industry standard
- Include level indicators for hierarchical positions (e.g., "Supervisor I", "Supervisor II")
- Use consistent terminology across similar positions

**Description Requirements**:
- Include primary responsibilities and duties
- Specify required skills and qualifications
- Note any special requirements or certifications
- Include reporting relationships where applicable

**Validation Rules**:
- Job names must be unique within each customer site
- Descriptions must contain at least 10 meaningful words
- Department assignment must exist in system
- Job category must be from approved list

### BR-JC-003: Job Group Organization and Hierarchy

  - >15% increase: Executive approval

**Rate Assignment Logic**:
```
IF new_rate >= minimum_wage AND new_rate <= max_allowed_rate THEN
    IF rate_change_percentage <= approval_threshold THEN
        ASSIGN rate with appropriate approval
    ELSE
        REQUIRE higher level approval
ELSE
    REJECT rate assignment
```
