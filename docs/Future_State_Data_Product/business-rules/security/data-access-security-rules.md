# Data Access Security Rules

## Overview

This document establishes comprehensive data access security rules for protecting sensitive data and ensuring authorized access across all Towne Park systems. These rules define access controls, data classification, and security procedures for maintaining data confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

## Core Security Principles

### Principle of Least Privilege
- Users granted minimum access necessary for job functions
- Regular review and validation of access permissions
- Automatic access revocation upon role changes
- Time-limited access for temporary requirements

### Defense in Depth
- Multiple layers of security controls
- Authentication, authorization, and audit controls
- Network, application, and data-level security
- Redundant security measures for critical data

### Data Classification
- Systematic classification of all data assets
- Security controls based on data sensitivity
- Clear handling procedures for each classification
- Regular review and reclassification procedures

### Zero Trust Model
- Verify every access request regardless of source
- Continuous validation of user identity and device
- Micro-segmentation of network and data access
- Assume breach and limit blast radius

## Data Classification Framework

### Classification Levels

#### Public Data (Level 0)
- **Definition**: Information intended for public consumption
- **Examples**: Marketing materials, public announcements, published reports
- **Access Controls**: No special access controls required
- **Handling**: Standard business handling procedures

#### Internal Data (Level 1)
- **Definition**: Information for internal business use
- **Examples**: Internal policies, procedures, general business communications
- **Access Controls**: Authenticated user access within organization
- **Handling**: Standard internal handling procedures

#### Confidential Data (Level 2)
- **Definition**: Sensitive business information requiring protection
- **Examples**: Financial data, customer information, contract details
- **Access Controls**: Role-based access with business justification
- **Handling**: Encrypted storage and transmission required

#### Restricted Data (Level 3)
- **Definition**: Highly sensitive information requiring maximum protection
- **Examples**: Personal identifiable information (PII), payment card data, legal documents
- **Access Controls**: Strict role-based access with approval workflow
- **Handling**: Maximum security controls and audit logging

#### Regulated Data (Level 4)
- **Definition**: Data subject to regulatory compliance requirements
- **Examples**: Healthcare data (HIPAA), financial data (SOX), personal data (GDPR)
- **Access Controls**: Compliance-driven access controls and monitoring
- **Handling**: Regulatory compliance procedures and controls
