# Contract Escalation Business Rules

## Overview

Contract escalation rules define the systematic approach for adjusting contract rates and fees annually or at specified intervals. These rules ensure consistent application of rate increases across all contract types while maintaining compliance with contractual obligations and market standards.

## Escalation Types and Calculations

### Fixed Percentage Escalations

#### Standard Fixed Rate Increases
- **Application**: Most common escalation method
- **Typical Ranges**: 3% to 5% annually
- **Calculation**: `New Rate = Current Rate Ã— (1 + Escalation Percentage)`
- **Examples from Contract Data**:
  - 3% annual increase: `$25.00 â†’ $25.75`
  - 4% annual increase: `$30.00 â†’ $31.20`
  - 5% annual increase: `$35.00 â†’ $36.75`

#### Contract-Specific Fixed Rates
- **Custom Percentages**: Based on individual contract negotiations
- **Range**: 2% to 7% depending on contract terms
- **Documentation**: Specific percentage documented in contract terms
- **Override Capability**: Manual adjustment for special circumstances

### Consumer Price Index (CPI) Escalations

#### CPI Calculation Method
- **Data Source**: Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) CPI-U data
- **Measurement Period**: 12-month period ending prior to escalation date
- **Formula**: `CPI Escalation = (Current CPI - Prior Year CPI) / Prior Year CPI`
- **Minimum Floor**: Typically 0% (no negative escalations)
- **Maximum Cap**: Often 6-8% to prevent excessive increases

#### CPI Application Rules
1. **Timing**: Applied on contract anniversary date
2. **Rounding**: Rounded to nearest 0.1% or as specified in contract
3. **Notification**: 60-90 days advance notice to customers
4. **Documentation**: CPI data source and calculation method documented

### Employment Cost Index (ECI) Escalations

#### ECI Calculation Method
- **Data Source**: Bureau of Labor Statistics ECI for service industries
- **Measurement**: Total compensation costs including wages and benefits
- **Formula**: `ECI Escalation = (Current ECI - Prior Year ECI) / Prior Year ECI`
- **Application**: Primarily for labor-intensive contracts (PLH, management)

#### ECI-Specific Rules
- **Service Sector Focus**: Uses service industry ECI data
- **Regional Adjustments**: May apply regional ECI variations
- **Lag Period**: Typically 3-6 month lag for data availability
- **Validation**: Cross-reference with multiple ECI series

### Greater-Of Formulas

#### Hybrid Escalation Models
- **Structure**: `Greater of X% or Index-Based Calculation`
- **Common Examples**:
  - Greater of 3% or CPI
  - Greater of 4% or ECI
  - Greater of 2.5% or CPI + 1%

#### Implementation Rules
1. **Calculate Both**: Compute fixed percentage and index-based amounts
2. **Compare Values**: Select higher of the two calculations
3. **Apply Result**: Use greater value for rate adjustment
4. **Document Choice**: Record which method was applied

## Contract Type-Specific Rules

### Fixed Fee Contract Escalations

#### Management Fee Escalations
- **Standard Method**: Annual CPI or fixed percentage
- **Typical Range**: 3-5% or CPI with 6% cap
- **Application Date**: Contract anniversary or January 1st
- **Components Affected**:
  - Base management fees
  - Administrative fees
  - Support service charges

#### Service Fee Escalations
- **Method**: Often tied to ECI for labor components
- **Calculation**: `New Fee = Base Fee Ã— (1 + ECI Increase)`
- **Special Considerations**: Separate escalations for different service types

### Per Labor Hour (PLH) Contract Escalations

#### Hourly Rate Adjustments
- **Primary Method**: ECI-based escalations
- **Rationale**: Direct correlation with labor cost increases
- **Rate Categories**:
  - Manager rates: ECI + premium adjustment
  - GSC (Guest Service Coordinator) rates: Standard ECI
  - GSA (Guest Service Associate) rates: Standard ECI
  - Cashier rates: Standard ECI or minimum wage adjustments

#### Overtime Rate Calculations
- **Base Calculation**: `Overtime Rate = Regular Rate Ã— 1.5`
- **Escalation**: Applied to base rate, then overtime multiplier applied
- **Example**: `$20/hr base â†’ $21/hr escalated â†’ $31.50/hr overtime`

### Revenue Share Contract Escalations

#### Percentage Rate Adjustments
- **Method**: Typically fixed percentage increases
- **Application**: Applied to revenue sharing percentage
- **Example**: `15% revenue share â†’ 15.45% (3% increase)`
- **Validation**: Ensure percentage remains within contractual limits

#### Threshold Adjustments
- **Validation Thresholds**: Escalated annually with revenue percentages
- **Calculation**: `New Threshold = Current Threshold Ã— (1 + Escalation Rate)`
- **Purpose**: Maintain proportional validation levels

## Timing and Implementation Rules

### Escalation Schedule

#### Annual Escalation Dates
- **Contract Anniversary**: Most common approach
- **Calendar Year**: January 1st implementation
- **Fiscal Year**: July 1st for some government contracts
- **Custom Dates**: As specified in individual contracts

#### Processing Timeline
1. **90 Days Prior**: Begin escalation calculations
2. **60 Days Prior**: Customer notification
3. **30 Days Prior**: System updates and testing
4. **Implementation Date**: New rates effective

### Notification Requirements

#### Customer Communication
- **Advance Notice**: Minimum 60 days, preferably 90 days
- **Content Requirements**:
  - Current rates and new rates
  - Escalation method and calculation
  - Effective date
  - Supporting documentation (CPI/ECI data)

#### Internal Notifications
- **Billing Team**: Rate table updates required
- **Account Management**: Customer communication coordination
- **Finance**: Revenue impact analysis
- **Systems**: Rate configuration updates

## Validation and Quality Control

### Calculation Validation

#### Automated Checks
- **Range Validation**: Escalations within expected ranges (0-10%)
- **Formula Verification**: Correct application of escalation formulas
- **Data Source Validation**: Current and accurate index data
- **Rate Consistency**: Consistent application across similar contracts

#### Manual Review Process
1. **Calculation Review**: Finance team verification
2. **Contract Compliance**: Legal review of escalation terms
3. **Customer Impact**: Account management assessment
4. **System Testing**: Billing system validation

### Exception Handling

#### Out-of-Range Escalations
- **High Escalations**: >8% require additional approval
- **Negative Escalations**: Typically floored at 0%
- **Data Issues**: Manual calculation if index data unavailable
- **Contract Disputes**: Hold escalation pending resolution

#### Override Procedures
- **Authorization Levels**: VP approval for >6% escalations
- **Documentation**: Written justification required
- **Customer Agreement**: Mutual consent for non-standard escalations
- **Audit Trail**: Complete record of override decisions

## Compliance and Audit Requirements

### Documentation Standards

#### Required Documentation
- **Escalation Calculations**: Complete calculation worksheets
- **Index Data**: Source data and methodology
- **Customer Notifications**: Copies of all communications
- **Approval Records**: Authorization for non-standard escalations

#### Retention Requirements
