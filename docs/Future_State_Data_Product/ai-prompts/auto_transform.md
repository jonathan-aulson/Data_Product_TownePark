I want you to read the files in the folder "ai-prompts" and know they are talking to you about your task.  Then, using the information from those files, I want you to pick any 1-2 (at most) files from the folder "Current_State_Data_Product" and follow the instructions given in the "ai-prompts" files.  Once those documents have been transformed, and you have Saved the resulting new documentation somewhere inside the folder structure found in "docs" folder (wherever most appropriate based on their content), updated the navigation, and thoroughly verified that you've complied with the rules, I want to you Move the files from Current_State_Data_Product into the Processed_Files folder and report your outcome.
