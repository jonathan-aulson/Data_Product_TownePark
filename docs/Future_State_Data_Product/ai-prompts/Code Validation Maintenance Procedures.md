# Code Validation Maintenance Procedures

## 🎯 PURPOSE

This document outlines the operational procedures for maintaining the code validation framework, ensuring validation accuracy, and managing the local code copy refresh process.

## 🏗️ CRITICAL PROJECT INFRASTRUCTURE

**IMPORTANT NOTES FOR ALL MAINTENANCE:**
- **Power Platform Code Directory**: The Towne Park Power Platform code directory is located at `Towne-Park-Billing-PA-Solution/` and DOES EXIST
- **Processed_Files Directory**: The `Processed_Files/` directory ALREADY EXISTS in the project workspace
- **Code Validation**: ALWAYS validate against the existing Power Platform code when applicable
- **Directory Structure**: The code directory contains BillingSystem/, BillingSystemCustomConnectors/, and other solution components

## 📋 MAINTENANCE OVERVIEW
