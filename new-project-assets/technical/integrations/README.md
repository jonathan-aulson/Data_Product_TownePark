# Integration Technical Documentation

This directory contains integration technical specifications and completed integration technical documents that follow the templated document creation protocol.

## Purpose

This directory serves dual purposes:

### 1. Integration Technical Specifications
Standard integration documentation including API specifications, data flows, and technical configurations.

### 2. Integration Technical Documents
Individual technical documents for system integrations, each following the comprehensive Integration Technical Document Template. Each document provides detailed specifications including:

- Field-level mapping between source and target systems
- Complete code logic documentation with snippets
- Execution schedules and timing
- Integration methods (API, file drop, ESB, etc.)
- Technical details including endpoints and functions
- Monitoring, alerting, and error handling procedures
- Mermaid flowcharts showing integration architecture

## Document Naming Conventions

### Integration Technical Documents
Integrations should be named using the following convention:
```
[IntegrationName]_Integration_TechnicalDocument.md
```

### Integration Technical Specifications
Standard integration documentation follows existing naming patterns:
```
YYYYMMDD_[SystemName]_[ComponentType]_[FeatureName].md
```

## Template Reference

Integration documents in this directory should be created using:
- **Template**: [Integration Technical Document Template](../specifications/templates/Integration-Technical-Document-Template.md)
- **Creation Protocol**: Follow the Mandatory Templated Document Creation Protocol as defined in the AI prompts

## Related Documentation

- [Report Technical Documents](../reports/) - Business report documentation
- [Data Model Technical Documents](../database/) - Data warehouse model documentation
- [Technical Specifications Templates](../specifications/templates/) - All available templates

## Quality Standards

All integration technical documents must include:
- Complete YAML frontmatter
- Comprehensive field-level mapping documentation
- Complete code logic with clear explanations
- Technical architecture diagrams using Mermaid
- Monitoring and error handling procedures
- Code validation when applicable
- Cross-references to related documentation
- Proper version control

## Integration Categories

This directory supports documentation for various integration types:
- **API Integrations**: REST/SOAP API connections
- **File-based Integrations**: FTP/SFTP file transfers
- **Database Integrations**: Direct database connections
- **ESB Integrations**: Enterprise Service Bus integrations
- **Real-time Integrations**: Streaming and event-driven integrations

## Existing Documents

This directory contains existing integration technical specifications that continue to follow their established documentation patterns while new integration documents follow the templated approach.
