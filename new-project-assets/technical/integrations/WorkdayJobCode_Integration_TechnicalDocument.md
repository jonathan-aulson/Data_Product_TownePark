## Data Sources and Extraction

### Workday Data Sources

**Primary Table**: Employee Job Data
- **Source**: Workday HCM Employee Records
- **Refresh Frequency**: Daily (overnight batch)
- **Data Volume**: ~50,000 employee records across 600+ sites
- **Key Fields**: Employee ID, Job Code, Job Title, Site ID, Effective Date, Status

**Secondary Table**: Job Code Master
- **Source**: Workday HCM Job Code Definitions
- **Refresh Frequency**: Weekly
- **Data Volume**: ~2,000 unique job codes
- **Key Fields**: Job Code, Job Title, Job Family, Status, Created Date

### Extraction Process

**Daily Extract Query**:
```sql
-- Workday job code and site association extraction
SELECT DISTINCT
    jc.job_code,
    jc.job_title,
    emp.site_id,
    COUNT(emp.employee_id) as active_employee_count,
    MAX(emp.last_updated_date) as last_activity_date,
    jc.job_family,
    jc.is_salary_position,
    jc.created_date as job_code_created_date
FROM workday_job_codes jc
INNER JOIN workday_employee_assignments emp 
    ON jc.job_code = emp.job_code
WHERE emp.status = 'Active'
    AND emp.effective_date <= GETDATE()
    AND (emp.end_date IS NULL OR emp.end_date > GETDATE())
    AND jc.status = 'Active'
GROUP BY 
    jc.job_code, 
    jc.job_title, 
    emp.site_id,
    jc.job_family,
    jc.is_salary_position,
    jc.created_date
```

**New Job Code Detection**:
```sql
-- Identify new job codes not yet in system
SELECT 
    w.job_code,
    w.job_title,
    w.job_family,
    w.created_date,
    COUNT(DISTINCT w.site_id) as site_count,
    SUM(w.active_employee_count) as total_employees
FROM workday_extract w
LEFT JOIN job_codes jc ON w.job_code = jc.job_code
WHERE jc.job_code_id IS NULL
GROUP BY w.job_code, w.job_title, w.job_family, w.created_date
ORDER BY w.created_date DESC
```

## Data Transformation Rules

### Job Code Standardization

**Naming Convention Validation**:
- Remove leading/trailing whitespace
- Convert to uppercase for consistency
- Validate alphanumeric + hyphen format
- Maximum length: 50 characters
- Reject codes with special characters (except hyphens)

**Job Title Processing**:
- Standardize capitalization (Title Case)
- Remove redundant words ("Position", "Role")
- Truncate to 200 characters maximum
- Handle null/empty titles (mark as new codes requiring review)

### Site Association Logic

**Valid Site Determination**:
```sql
-- Validate site associations
SELECT 
    w.job_code,
    w.site_id,
    s.site_name,
    w.active_employee_count
FROM workday_extract w
INNER JOIN sites s ON w.site_id = s.site_id
WHERE s.is_active = 1
    AND s.site_type IN ('Operational', 'Pilot')
    AND w.active_employee_count > 0
```

**Employee Count Validation**:
- Minimum threshold: 1 active employee
- Maximum threshold: 500 employees (data quality check)
- Zero employee count: Flag for review (possible data issue)
- Negative count: Reject and log error

### Data Quality Transformations

**Duplicate Resolution**:
- Same job code at multiple sites: Create separate associations
- Same job code with different titles: Flag for manual review
- Multiple job codes with same title: Allow (different operational roles)

**Historical Data Handling**:
- Preserve existing job code IDs for continuity
- Update employee counts and metadata
- Mark inactive associations where employees no longer exist
- Maintain audit trail of all changes

## Loading Process and Data Synchronization

### ETL Pipeline Stages

**Stage 1: Data Validation**
```sql
-- Validation checks before loading
DECLARE @ValidationErrors TABLE (
    job_code NVARCHAR(50),
    site_id INT,
    error_type NVARCHAR(100),
    error_message NVARCHAR(500)
)

-- Check for invalid job codes
INSERT INTO @ValidationErrors
SELECT job_code, site_id, 'Invalid Format', 'Job code contains invalid characters'
FROM workday_extract
WHERE job_code NOT LIKE '[A-Z0-9-]%'

-- Check for invalid site associations
INSERT INTO @ValidationErrors
SELECT job_code, site_id, 'Invalid Site', 'Site not found or inactive'
FROM workday_extract w
LEFT JOIN sites s ON w.site_id = s.site_id
WHERE s.site_id IS NULL OR s.is_active = 0
```

**Stage 2: Job Code Upsert**
```sql
-- Insert new job codes or update existing
MERGE job_codes AS target
USING (
    SELECT DISTINCT 
        job_code,
        job_title,
        CASE WHEN job_title IS NULL OR job_title = job_code 
             THEN 1 ELSE 0 END as is_new,
        is_salary_position,
        'Workday' as source_system
    FROM workday_extract
) AS source ON target.job_code = source.job_code
WHEN MATCHED THEN
    UPDATE SET 
        job_title = COALESCE(source.job_title, target.job_title),
        is_salary = source.is_salary_position,
        last_updated_date = GETUTCDATE(),
        updated_by = 'Workday_ETL'
WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN
    INSERT (job_code, job_title, is_new, is_salary, source_system, created_by)
    VALUES (source.job_code, source.job_title, source.is_new, 
            source.is_salary_position, source.source_system, 'Workday_ETL');
```

**Stage 3: Site Association Management**
```sql
-- Update job code site associations
MERGE job_code_site_associations AS target
USING (
    SELECT 
        jc.job_code_id,
        w.site_id,
        w.active_employee_count,
        GETDATE() as effective_date
    FROM workday_extract w
    INNER JOIN job_codes jc ON w.job_code = jc.job_code
) AS source ON target.job_code_id = source.job_code_id 
                AND target.site_id = source.site_id
WHEN MATCHED THEN
    UPDATE SET 
        active_employee_count = source.active_employee_count,
        is_active = 1,
        end_date = NULL,
        last_updated_date = GETUTCDATE()
WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN
    INSERT (job_code_id, site_id, active_employee_count, effective_date, is_active)
    VALUES (source.job_code_id, source.site_id, source.active_employee_count, 
            source.effective_date, 1);
```

### Change Detection and Notification

**New Job Code Alerts**:
```sql
-- Identify new job codes requiring admin attention
SELECT 
    jc.job_code,
    jc.job_title,
    COUNT(DISTINCT jcsa.site_id) as site_count,
    SUM(jcsa.active_employee_count) as total_employees,
    jc.created_date
FROM job_codes jc
INNER JOIN job_code_site_associations jcsa ON jc.job_code_id = jcsa.job_code_id
WHERE jc.is_new = 1
    AND jcsa.is_active = 1
GROUP BY jc.job_code, jc.job_title, jc.created_date
ORDER BY jc.created_date DESC
```

**Email Notification Process**:
- **Trigger**: New job codes detected in daily ETL
- **Recipients**: HR Team + System Administrators
- **Content**: Job code, affected sites, employee count
- **Frequency**: Daily digest (if new codes found)
- **Integration**: Leverage existing Wagefield notification process

## Error Handling and Data Quality

### Exception Management

**Data Quality Checks**:
```sql
-- Comprehensive data quality validation
WITH DataQualityChecks AS (
    SELECT 
        'Duplicate Job Codes' as check_type,
        COUNT(*) as issue_count
    FROM (
        SELECT job_code, COUNT(*) as cnt
        FROM job_codes 
        GROUP BY job_code 
        HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
    ) duplicates
    
    UNION ALL
    
    SELECT 
        'Orphaned Site Associations' as check_type,
        COUNT(*) as issue_count
    FROM job_code_site_associations jcsa
    LEFT JOIN job_codes jc ON jcsa.job_code_id = jc.job_code_id
    WHERE jc.job_code_id IS NULL
    
    UNION ALL
    
    SELECT 
        'Invalid Employee Counts' as check_type,
        COUNT(*) as issue_count
    FROM job_code_site_associations
    WHERE active_employee_count < 0 OR active_employee_count > 500
)
SELECT * FROM DataQualityChecks WHERE issue_count > 0
```

**Error Recovery Procedures**:
1. **Data Validation Failure**: Log error, skip record, continue processing
2. **Connection Timeout**: Retry with exponential backoff (3 attempts)
3. **Constraint Violation**: Log violation, attempt data correction, manual review
4. **Bulk Load Failure**: Rollback transaction, alert administrators, retry

### Data Reconciliation

**Daily Reconciliation Report**:
```sql
-- Compare Workday extract with current system state
SELECT 
    'Records Processed' as metric,
    COUNT(*) as workday_count,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM job_codes WHERE source_system = 'Workday') as system_count
FROM workday_extract

UNION ALL

SELECT 
    'Active Associations' as metric,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CONCAT(job_code, '-', site_id)) as workday_count,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM job_code_site_associations WHERE is_active = 1) as system_count
FROM workday_extract

UNION ALL

SELECT 
    'Total Employees' as metric,
    SUM(active_employee_count) as workday_count,
    (SELECT SUM(active_employee_count) FROM job_code_site_associations WHERE is_active = 1) as system_count
FROM workday_extract
```

## Performance Optimization

### ETL Performance Tuning

**Batch Processing Strategy**:
- **Batch Size**: 1,000 records per transaction
- **Parallel Processing**: 4 concurrent threads for site associations
- **Memory Management**: Stream processing for large datasets
- **Index Optimization**: Temporary indexes during bulk operations

**Query Optimization**:
```sql
-- Optimized extraction query with proper indexing
SELECT /*+ USE_INDEX(workday_employee_assignments, IX_emp_status_date) */
    jc.job_code,
    jc.job_title,
    emp.site_id,
    COUNT(emp.employee_id) as active_employee_count
FROM workday_job_codes jc WITH (NOLOCK)
INNER JOIN workday_employee_assignments emp WITH (NOLOCK)
    ON jc.job_code = emp.job_code
WHERE emp.status = 'Active'
    AND emp.effective_date <= GETDATE()
    AND ISNULL(emp.end_date, '9999-12-31') > GETDATE()
GROUP BY jc.job_code, jc.job_title, emp.site_id
```

### Monitoring and Alerting

**Performance Metrics**:
- **ETL Duration**: Target <30 minutes for full refresh
- **Record Throughput**: Target >1,000 records/minute
- **Error Rate**: Target <0.1% of processed records
- **Data Freshness**: Maximum 24-hour lag from Workday

**Automated Monitoring**:
```sql
-- ETL performance monitoring
INSERT INTO etl_performance_log (
    process_name,
    start_time,
    end_time,
    records_processed,
    records_failed,
    duration_minutes
)
SELECT 
    'Workday_Job_Code_ETL',
    @start_time,
    GETUTCDATE(),
    @records_processed,
    @records_failed,
    DATEDIFF(MINUTE, @start_time, GETUTCDATE())
```
