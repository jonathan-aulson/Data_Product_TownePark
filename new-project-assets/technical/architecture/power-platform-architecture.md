# Power Platform Architecture

## Overview

This document defines the comprehensive architecture for Towne Park's Power Platform implementation. The architecture encompasses Power Apps, Power Automate, Power BI, and Dataverse, providing a unified platform for business applications, workflow automation, analytics, and data management.

## Architectural Principles

### Design Principles

#### Principle 1: Cloud-First Architecture
All components are designed for cloud-native deployment with hybrid connectivity for on-premises integration.

#### Principle 2: Scalable and Resilient
Architecture supports horizontal scaling and includes comprehensive resilience patterns for high availability.

#### Principle 3: Security by Design
Security controls are integrated at every layer with zero-trust principles and comprehensive audit capabilities.

#### Principle 4: API-First Integration
All integrations follow API-first design patterns with standardized interfaces and comprehensive documentation.

#### Principle 5: Data-Driven Decision Making
Architecture supports real-time analytics and business intelligence across all business processes.
