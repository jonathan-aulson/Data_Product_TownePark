# SharePoint Integration Architecture

## Overview

This document defines the comprehensive architecture for integrating Microsoft SharePoint with the Towne Park data platform. The architecture encompasses document management, collaboration workflows, data synchronization, and business process automation across SharePoint Online and on-premises SharePoint environments.
