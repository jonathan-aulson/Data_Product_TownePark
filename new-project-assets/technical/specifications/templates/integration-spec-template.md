## Best Practices

### Integration Design Principles
1. **Loose Coupling**: Minimize dependencies between systems
2. **High Cohesion**: Group related functionality together
3. **Fault Tolerance**: Design for failure and recovery
4. **Scalability**: Plan for growth and increased load
5. **Security**: Implement defense in depth

### Common Integration Patterns
1. **Request-Response**: Synchronous communication pattern
2. **Publish-Subscribe**: Event-driven communication pattern
3. **Message Queue**: Asynchronous communication pattern
4. **Batch Processing**: Scheduled data transfer pattern
5. **API Gateway**: Centralized API management pattern

### Success Factors
- Clear business requirements and objectives
- Comprehensive technical specifications
- Thorough testing and validation
- Proper error handling and monitoring
- Effective change management and governance
