**Documentation Claim**: AI tools use `.clinerules` files for project context
**Validation Result**: ‚úÖ **CONFIRMED**

**Evidence Found**:
```
Towne-Park-Billing-Source-Code/Towne Park Billing/.clinerules/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.MD
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ coding-guidelines.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pull-request-review-guidelines.md
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ project-summary.md (referenced)
```

**Actual Implementation Quote**:

**Validation Score**: 100% - Perfect match

#### 2. AI Tool Integration (Cline)
**Documentation Claim**: Root Code/Claude integration for development assistance
**Validation Result**: ‚úÖ **CONFIRMED**

**Evidence Found**:
```markdown
# Cline and Clinerules
## Introduction
Cline is a tool designed to streamline development processes by providing guidelines and rules for coding standards.

## Usage
- install cline extension for vscode.
- You can either use your own api key or use models through github pro license.
```

**Validation Score**: 95% - Cline confirmed as actual AI tool in use

#### 3. MCP Server Integration
**Documentation Claim**: MCP servers for Azure DevOps integration
**Validation Result**: ‚úÖ **CONFIRMED**

**Evidence Found**:
```markdown
## Available Azure DevOps MCP Tools

### Pull Request Management
- `list_pull_requests` - List pull requests in a repository
- `get_pull_request_comments` - Get comments from a specific pull request
- `add_pull_request_comment` - Add a comment to a pull request
- `update_pull_request` - Update an existing pull request

### Repository & Code Analysis
- `get_file_content` - Get content of a file or directory from a repository
- `search_code` - Search for code across repositories in a project

**Default Configuration**: Most commands use defaults for Towne Park setup:
- Default Organization: `towne-park`
- Default Project: `Towne Park Billing`
```

**Validation Score**: 100% - Exact match with documented MCP capabilities

#### 4. Development Architecture Patterns
**Documentation Claim**: Clean Architecture, SOLID principles, specific folder structure
**Validation Result**: ‚úÖ **CONFIRMED**

**Evidence Found**:
```markdown
### Backend (.NET) ‚Äì Feature Implementation Flow
#### 1. **Repository Layer (`Data/Impl/`)**
#### 2. **Service Layer (`Services/Impl/`)**
#### 3. **Adapter Layer (`Adapters/Impl/` and `Adapters/Mappers/`)**
#### 4. **Function/API Layer (`Functions/`)**

### Project Structure
- Organize the project into layers: Controllers, Services, Repositories, and Models.
- Use Dependency Injection to manage service lifetimes and dependencies.
- All backend functions are implemented as Azure Functions.
```

**Validation Score**: 100% - Architecture patterns exactly match documentation

#### 5. Technology Stack
**Documentation Claim**: React + TypeScript frontend, .NET Azure Functions backend
**Validation Result**: ‚úÖ **CONFIRMED**

**Evidence Found**:
```markdown
### Frontend Stack (React + TypeScript)
- **Framework**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS + Radix UI components
- **State Management**: React hooks + Context API

### Backend Stack (.NET Core)
- **API Layer**: `/api/src/Functions/` - Azure Functions with HTTP triggers
- **Models**: `/api/src/Models/Dto/` - Data Transfer Objects
- **Services**: `/api/src/Services/` - Business logic layer
```

**Validation Score**: 100% - Technology stack perfectly aligned

#### 6. Testing Standards
**Documentation Claim**: Comprehensive testing with specific frameworks
**Validation Result**: ‚úÖ **CONFIRMED**

**Evidence Found**:
```markdown
### Testing
- Write unit tests for all components using Jest and React Testing Library.
- Write unit tests for all services and controllers using xUnit or NUnit.
- Use mocking frameworks like Moq to isolate tests.
- All backend tests should be created in the `api/tests` directory.
- Aim for at least 80% code coverage across both frontend and backend.
```

**Validation Score**: 100% - Testing requirements exactly match

#### 7. Mapping and DTOs
**Documentation Claim**: Mapperly for object mapping, specific DTO patterns
**Validation Result**: ‚úÖ **CONFIRMED**

**Evidence Found**:
```markdown
### Mapping and VOs (Required Practice)
- Use Value Objects (VOs) to encapsulate domain logic and ensure immutability.
- **All mapping between domain models, VOs, and DTOs must be performed using [Mapperly](https://mapperly.riok.app/).**
- Do not write manual mapping code or use any other mapping libraries.
- Define all mapping logic in dedicated Mapperly mapper classes (e.g., `ContractMapper`, `UpdateContractMapper`).
```

**Validation Score**: 100% - Mapperly usage exactly as documented

### ‚ö†Ô∏è MINOR DISCREPANCIES

#### 1. AI Tool Name Variation
**Documentation**: References "Root Code" as primary AI tool
**Actual Implementation**: Uses "Cline" as the AI development assistant
**Impact**: Low - Both are AI development tools with similar functionality
**Recommendation**: Update documentation to reflect Cline usage or note both tools

#### 2. Context File Extensions
**Documentation**: References `.clinerules` and `.cursorrules` files
**Actual Implementation**: Uses `.clinerules/` directory structure
**Impact**: Low - Concept is correct, implementation uses directory vs. files
**Recommendation**: Update documentation to reflect directory-based approach

### üîç ADDITIONAL VALIDATION FINDINGS

#### Business Domain Terminology
**Validation Result**: ‚úÖ **CONFIRMED**

**Evidence Found**:
```markdown
## Glossary of Terms
- **Account Manager**: Role responsible for a given location in Towne Park
- **Additional Fees or Line Items**: Optional charges added to invoices
- **Deal Types**: Predefined configurations for billing agreements
- **Fixed Fee**: A straightforward billing model often used in hospital locations
- **Per Labor Hour Agreements**: Billing based on the number of labor hours recorded
- **Revenue Share**: A partnership-like agreement where parking revenue is split
```

**Validation Score**: 100% - Business terminology perfectly aligned

#### Code Quality Standards
**Validation Result**: ‚úÖ **CONFIRMED**

**Evidence Found**:
```markdown
## General Standards
- Follow consistent naming conventions for files, classes, and functions.
- Maintain clear and concise documentation for all components and services.
- Code must be modular, reusable, and maintainable
- Use abstraction and interfaces to decouple high-level logic from low-level implementation
- Leverage design patterns and architectural best practices
```

**Validation Score**: 100% - Quality standards exactly match documentation
