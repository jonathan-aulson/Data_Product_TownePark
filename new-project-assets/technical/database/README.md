# Database and Data Model Technical Documentation

This directory contains database technical specifications and completed data model technical documents that follow the templated document creation protocol.

## Purpose

This directory serves dual purposes:

### 1. Database Technical Specifications
Standard database documentation including schemas, configurations, and technical specifications.

### 2. Data Model Technical Documents
Individual technical documents for Enterprise Data Warehouse data models, each following the comprehensive Data Model Technical Document Template. Each document provides detailed specifications including:

- Complete field mappings with source systems
- Business logic and transformation rules
- Run-time calculations and key figures
- Mermaid flowcharts showing system relationships
- Reports built from the data model
- Dataset sizing and performance metrics
- Indexing and archiving strategies
- Data management approaches

## Document Naming Conventions

### Data Model Technical Documents
Data models should be named using the following convention:
```
[ModelName]_DataModel_TechnicalDocument.md
```

### Database Technical Specifications
Standard database documentation follows existing naming patterns:
```
YYYYMMDD_[SystemName]_[ComponentType]_[FeatureName].md
```

## Template Reference

Data model documents in this directory should be created using:
- **Template**: [Data Model Technical Document Template](../specifications/templates/DataModel-Technical-Document-Template.md)
- **Creation Protocol**: Follow the Mandatory Templated Document Creation Protocol as defined in the AI prompts

## Related Documentation

- [Report Technical Documents](../reports/) - Business report documentation
- [Integration Technical Documents](../integrations/) - System integration documentation
- [Technical Specifications Templates](../specifications/templates/) - All available templates

## Quality Standards

All data model technical documents must include:
- Complete YAML frontmatter
- Comprehensive field-level documentation with source mappings
- Business logic and transformation specifications
- Mermaid flowcharts for data relationships
- Code validation when applicable
- Cross-references to related documentation
- Proper version control

## Existing Documents

This directory contains existing database technical specifications that continue to follow their established documentation patterns while new data model documents follow the templated approach.
