## Logic and Definitions - Field by Field

### Core Velocity Metrics

**Story Points Completed**
- **Definition**: Total story points for stories marked as "Done" within sprint timeframe
- **Calculation**: SUM(story_points) WHERE state = 'Done' AND completed_date BETWEEN sprint_start AND sprint_end
- **Business Logic**: Only count stories that meet Definition of Done criteria
- **Exclusions**: Stories moved to next sprint, incomplete stories, cancelled stories

**Velocity Ratio**
- **Definition**: Ratio of actual story points completed to historical average
- **Calculation**: current_sprint_points / rolling_average_points (last 6 sprints)
- **Baseline**: Pre-AI tool implementation average (Sprints 20-27)
- **Target**: 120% of baseline velocity

**Sprint Completion Rate**
- **Definition**: Percentage of committed story points actually completed
- **Calculation**: (completed_story_points / committed_story_points) × 100
- **Target**: 95% completion rate
- **Quality Gate**: Stories must pass all acceptance criteria

### AI Tool Impact Metrics

**AI Tool Adoption Rate**
- **Definition**: Percentage of development time using AI-assisted tools
- **Calculation**: (ai_tool_hours / total_development_hours) × 100
- **Data Source**: Development tool telemetry and time tracking
- **Target**: 60% adoption rate across team

**AI Productivity Multiplier**
- **Definition**: Productivity increase attributable to AI tool usage
- **Calculation**: (ai_assisted_velocity - baseline_velocity) / baseline_velocity
- **Baseline**: Average velocity from Sprints 20-27 (pre-AI implementation)
- **Current Achievement**: 85% productivity increase (Sprint 28)

**Code Generation Efficiency**
- **Definition**: Lines of code generated per hour with AI assistance
- **Calculation**: ai_generated_lines / ai_tool_usage_hours
- **Quality Adjustment**: Weighted by code review pass rate
- **Benchmark**: 150 lines/hour target with 90%+ quality score

### Quality and Delivery Metrics

**Code Quality Score**
- **Definition**: Composite score of code quality metrics
- **Components**: Static analysis score (40%), test coverage (30%), review feedback (30%)
- **Calculation**: weighted_average(static_score, test_coverage, review_score)
- **Target**: 90% minimum quality score
- **AI Impact**: Monitor quality maintenance despite increased velocity

**Defect Rate**
- **Definition**: Number of bugs per story point delivered
- **Calculation**: total_bugs_found / total_story_points_delivered
- **Time Window**: 30 days post-delivery for defect attribution
- **Target**: <0.1 bugs per story point
- **Quality Gate**: No increase in defect rate despite velocity gains

**Time to Market**
- **Definition**: Average time from story creation to production deployment
- **Calculation**: AVG(deployment_date - story_created_date)
- **Components**: Development time, testing time, review time, deployment time
- **Target**: 14 days average time to market
- **AI Impact**: Measure reduction in development phase duration

## AI Tool Impact Analysis

### Tool Usage Breakdown

**Primary AI Tools**
- **Code Generation**: GitHub Copilot, Claude, ChatGPT
- **Code Review**: AI-assisted pull request analysis
- **Testing**: Automated test case generation
- **Documentation**: AI-assisted documentation creation

**Usage Patterns**
```sql
SELECT 
    tool_name,
    AVG(daily_usage_hours) as avg_daily_usage,
    SUM(code_lines_generated) as total_lines_generated,
    AVG(quality_score) as avg_quality_score
FROM ai_tool_usage
WHERE sprint_id = @current_sprint
GROUP BY tool_name
ORDER BY avg_daily_usage DESC
```

### Productivity Impact Calculation

**Baseline Establishment**
- **Pre-AI Period**: Sprints 20-27 (8 sprint average)
- **Baseline Velocity**: 38.5 story points per sprint
- **Baseline Quality**: 92% average quality score
- **Baseline Delivery**: 95% completion rate

**AI-Enhanced Performance**
- **Sprint 28 Achievement**: 70.6 story points (83% increase)
- **Quality Maintenance**: 94% quality score (+2% improvement)
- **Delivery Excellence**: 100% completion rate (+5% improvement)
- **Efficiency Gain**: Nearly doubled productivity while improving quality

### ROI Analysis

**Investment Costs**
- **Tool Licensing**: $50/developer/month for AI tools
- **Training Time**: 40 hours initial training per developer
- **Setup and Integration**: 80 hours one-time setup cost
- **Ongoing Support**: 10 hours/month team support

**Productivity Returns**
- **Velocity Increase**: 83% improvement in story point delivery
- **Time Savings**: ~40 hours/sprint saved in development time
- **Quality Improvement**: 2% reduction in rework and bug fixes
- **Delivery Reliability**: 5% improvement in sprint commitment achievement

**ROI Calculation**
```
Monthly Investment: $250 (tools) + $2,000 (support) = $2,250
Monthly Return: 40 hours × $100/hour × 2 sprints = $8,000
Monthly ROI: ($8,000 - $2,250) / $2,250 = 256% ROI
```
