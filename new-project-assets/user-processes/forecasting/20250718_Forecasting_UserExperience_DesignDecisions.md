# Towne Park Forecasting - User Experience Design Decisions

## Purpose

This document provides comprehensive documentation of user experience design decisions, UI terminology choices, and feature prioritization for the Towne Park forecasting system. Based on backlog grooming sessions and product management discussions, it establishes the rationale behind key design decisions and serves as a reference for ongoing development and user experience optimization.

## Executive Summary

The forecasting system user experience design has been refined through comprehensive stakeholder discussions focusing on tab naming conventions, feature prioritization, and workflow optimization. Key decisions include retaining the "Statistics" tab name for vehicle and occupancy data, prioritizing Legion schedule copying functionality over variance display tables, and implementing specific UI cleanup improvements. These decisions balance user familiarity, technical constraints, and operational workflow requirements.

## Design Decision Framework

### Decision-Making Process
The user experience design decisions follow a structured process involving:
- **Stakeholder Input**: Product owners, business analysts, and field operations feedback
- **User Research**: Understanding account manager and district manager workflows
- **Technical Constraints**: Real estate limitations and system integration requirements
- **Operational Impact**: Field communication and training considerations

### Priority Framework
1. **High Priority**: Features that significantly improve daily workflows
2. **Medium Priority**: UI improvements and terminology optimization
3. **Low Priority**: Aesthetic enhancements and advanced visualization features

## Tab Naming and Navigation Design

### Statistics Tab Design Decision

#### Context and Challenge
The Statistics tab contains both vehicle volume data and occupancy information, creating a naming challenge that reflects the dual nature of the content while maintaining user clarity.

#### Naming Options Evaluated

| Option | Pros | Cons | Stakeholder Feedback |
|--------|------|------|---------------------|
| **Statistics** (Current) | Familiar to users, encompasses both data types | Not descriptive of specific content | Acceptable compromise |
| **Vehicle Volume** | Clear indication of primary content | Doesn't include occupancy data | Too narrow in scope |
| **Demand** | Industry-standard terminology | May confuse account managers | Requires user education |
| **Vehicle/Demand** | Comprehensive description | Real estate constraints for headers | Technical implementation issues |

#### Final Decision: Statistics Tab Retained

**Decision**: Keep "Statistics" as the tab name  
**Rationale**: 
- Balances clarity with content comprehensiveness
- Avoids real estate constraints for column headers
- Maintains familiarity for existing users
- Accommodates both vehicle and occupancy data

**Implementation Details**:
- Tab name remains "Statistics"
- Individual column headers provide specific data type context
- User training materials will clarify tab content
- Future iterations may revisit naming based on user feedback

#### Design Constraints Addressed

**Real Estate Limitations** (Amy Sowells): "I know real estate is a problem though."
- Screen space optimization requires concise naming
- Column header space limitations impact detailed descriptions
- Mobile responsiveness considerations for tab navigation

**User Understanding** (Adam Suarez): "I think the main concern was w[hether people understand it]"
- Primary focus on user comprehension over perfect terminology
- Acceptable compromise approach balances multiple considerations
- Field user feedback will inform future iterations

### Navigation Architecture

#### Tab Structure Design
The forecasting system tab structure follows a logical workflow progression:

1. **Statistics Tab**: Vehicle volume and occupancy data entry
2. **Payroll Tab**: Labor forecasting and Legion integration
3. **Other Revenue Tab**: Additional revenue stream forecasting
4. **Other Expenses Tab**: Expense forecasting and budget comparison
5. **P&L View Tab**: Comprehensive financial summary

#### Information Architecture Principles
- **Workflow-Based Organization**: Tabs follow natural forecasting process
- **Content Clarity**: Each tab has distinct, non-overlapping content
- **User Mental Model**: Aligns with existing account manager processes
- **Scalability**: Design accommodates future feature additions

## Feature Prioritization and User Workflow

### High-Priority Features

#### Legion Schedule Copy Functionality

**Priority Level**: High  
**Rationale**: Significant workflow improvement for account managers  
**Impact**: Reduces manual data entry and improves forecast accuracy

**Feature Description**:
One-click copying of scheduled hours from Legion system into forecast data, available from both view and edit modes.

**User Workflow Enhancement**:
- **Current Process**: Manual data entry from Legion schedules
- **Enhanced Process**: Single-click copy with automatic data population
- **Time Savings**: Estimated 15-20 minutes per forecasting session
- **Error Reduction**: Eliminates manual transcription errors

**Implementation Vision** (Jonathan Aulson): "I want there to be a just a link that allows them to copy this any scheduled. Information scheduled hours into the forecasted date."

**Technical Requirements**:
- Integration with Legion API for scheduled data retrieval
- One-click copy functionality in both view and edit modes
- Data validation to ensure integrity during copy process
- User confirmation dialog for copy operations

**Communication Strategy** (Adam Suarez): "A pretty big enhancement that we're probably gonna wanna communicate to the field."
- Field training materials development
- Change management communication plan
- User adoption tracking and feedback collection

#### User Experience Benefits
- **Efficiency**: Dramatic reduction in manual data entry time
- **Accuracy**: Eliminates transcription errors from Legion to forecast
- **Consistency**: Ensures alignment between scheduled and forecasted data
- **Usability**: Intuitive one-click operation requires minimal training

### Medium-Priority Features

#### Variance Display Tables (Deferred)

**Priority Level**: Deferred  
**Rationale**: Existing visualization provides adequate information  
**Current Alternative**: Line comparison charts with hover functionality

**Decision Context** (Adam Suarez): "I think they can deal with the line comparison and like the hover over rollout, I mean it's should be able to visually get like a good idea with those lines where you landed in in any given day."

**Current Visualization Capabilities**:
- Line chart comparisons between actual and forecast
- Hover-over details for specific data points
- Visual trend identification across time periods
- Adequate information density for decision-making

**Future Implementation Consideration**:
- May be reconsidered based on user feedback
- Could be implemented as optional advanced view
- Would require additional screen real estate
- Lower priority than workflow efficiency features

### UI Cleanup and Enhancement

#### Other Revenue Tab Improvements

**Enhancement**: Remove green background formatting  
**Rationale**: Tab serves as input form, not comparison interface  
**Impact**: Cleaner visual design and reduced visual noise

**Current Issue** (Jonathan Aulson): "Other revenue that we're not doing any comparisons there. That's just a intake form. We do need, so we built that with that green background, which we need to remove."

**Design Solution**:
- Remove green background highlighting
- Maintain clean, form-based interface
- Focus on data input clarity
- No comparison functionality required

#### Other Expenses Display Enhancement

**Enhancement**: Split display for current month with conditional formatting  
**Purpose**: Show both forecast and actual data for current month  
**Implementation**: Second row display with appropriate visual indicators

**Design Specifications**:
- Current month shows both forecast and actual values
- Historical months show actual values only
- Future months show forecast values only
- Clear visual distinction between data types
