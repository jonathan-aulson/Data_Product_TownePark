# Code Review Guidelines

## Purpose

This document establishes comprehensive guidelines for code review processes within Towne Park's development workflow, ensuring consistent code quality, knowledge sharing, and adherence to development standards.

## Code Review Principles

### Core Objectives
- **Quality Assurance**: Ensure code meets quality standards and requirements
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Facilitate knowledge transfer across team members
- **Consistency**: Maintain consistent coding patterns and practices
- **Security**: Identify and address security vulnerabilities
- **Performance**: Optimize code for performance and efficiency

### Review Philosophy
- Constructive and respectful feedback
- Focus on code improvement, not personal criticism
- Collaborative problem-solving approach
- Continuous learning and improvement mindset

## Review Process Workflow

### 1. Pre-Review Preparation

#### Author Responsibilities
- **Self-Review**: Conduct thorough self-review before submission
- **Documentation**: Ensure code is properly documented
- **Testing**: Verify all tests pass and coverage requirements are met
- **Standards Compliance**: Confirm adherence to coding standards
- **Clear Description**: Provide clear pull request description and context

#### Review Request Preparation
```markdown
## Pull Request Template
**Description**: [Clear description of changes]
**Type of Change**: [Bug fix | Feature | Refactor | Documentation]
**Testing**: [Description of testing performed]
**Breaking Changes**: [Yes/No - with details if yes]
**Related Issues**: [Link to related issues or tickets]

## Checklist
- [ ] Code follows established coding standards
- [ ] Self-review completed
- [ ] Tests added/updated and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] No breaking changes (or properly documented)
```

### 2. Review Assignment

#### Reviewer Selection Criteria
- **Expertise**: Relevant domain knowledge and technical expertise
- **Availability**: Capacity to provide timely review
- **Diversity**: Mix of senior and junior reviewers when appropriate
- **Code Ownership**: Include code owners for affected areas

#### Review Timeline
- **Standard Reviews**: 24-48 hours for initial review
- **Critical/Hotfix**: 2-4 hours for urgent changes
- **Large Features**: 48-72 hours for complex changes
- **Documentation**: 24 hours for documentation-only changes

### 3. Review Execution

#### Review Focus Areas

##### Code Quality
- **Readability**: Code is clear and easy to understand
- **Maintainability**: Code is well-structured and modular
- **Reusability**: Common functionality is properly abstracted
- **Complexity**: Code complexity is appropriate and manageable

##### Functionality
- **Requirements**: Code meets specified requirements
- **Edge Cases**: Proper handling of edge cases and error conditions
- **Business Logic**: Correct implementation of business rules
- **Integration**: Proper integration with existing systems

##### Security
- **Input Validation**: Proper validation of all inputs
- **Authentication**: Correct authentication and authorization
- **Data Protection**: Sensitive data is properly protected
- **Vulnerability Assessment**: No known security vulnerabilities

##### Performance
- **Efficiency**: Code is optimized for performance
- **Resource Usage**: Appropriate use of system resources
- **Scalability**: Code can handle expected load and growth
- **Database Queries**: Optimized database interactions

#### Review Comments Guidelines

##### Constructive Feedback Format
```markdown
**Issue Type**: [Critical | Major | Minor | Suggestion | Question]
**Category**: [Security | Performance | Maintainability | Standards]
**Description**: [Clear description of the issue]
**Suggestion**: [Specific recommendation for improvement]
**Example**: [Code example if applicable]
```

##### Comment Categories
- **Critical**: Must be fixed before merge (security, functionality)
- **Major**: Should be fixed before merge (performance, maintainability)
- **Minor**: Could be improved (style, optimization)
- **Suggestion**: Optional improvement (alternative approach)
- **Question**: Clarification needed (understanding, rationale)

### 4. Review Resolution

#### Response Process
- **Acknowledgment**: Author acknowledges all review comments
- **Discussion**: Collaborative discussion for complex issues
- **Implementation**: Author implements agreed-upon changes
- **Re-review**: Reviewer validates implemented changes

#### Approval Criteria
- All critical and major issues resolved
- Code meets quality standards
- Tests pass and coverage maintained
- Documentation updated appropriately
- Security and performance requirements met
