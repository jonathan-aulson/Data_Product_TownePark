# UAT Methodology User Process Guide

## Overview

This comprehensive guide outlines the User Acceptance Testing (UAT) methodology for Towne Park's forecasting system, providing step-by-step processes for conducting effective UAT sessions that prioritize user feedback and system quality validation.

## UAT Process Framework

### Phase 1: Pre-UAT Preparation

#### 1.1 System Readiness Assessment

**Responsible Role:** Product Owner, Business Analyst  
**Prerequisites:** Feature development completion, internal testing completion  
**Duration:** 1-2 business days

**Process Steps:**

1. **Feature Completion Verification**
   - Verify Internal Revenue completion on P&L view
   - Confirm payroll override concept implementation
   - Validate core functionality stability
   - Review system performance benchmarks

2. **Quality Gate Assessment**
   - Conduct internal system testing
   - Document and resolve critical issues
   - Perform system polish activities
   - Validate user interface consistency

3. **UAT Readiness Checklist**
   - [ ] All planned features implemented and tested
   - [ ] Critical bugs resolved
   - [ ] System performance meets baseline requirements
   - [ ] User interface polish completed
   - [ ] Test data prepared and validated
   - [ ] UAT environment configured and accessible

**Quality Standards:**
- System must be beyond "rough" state as identified in planning sessions
- All blocking issues must be resolved before field user involvement
- Performance must meet acceptable response time thresholds

#### 1.2 Participant Selection and Preparation

**Responsible Role:** Product Owner  
**Target Participants:** Account Managers (AMs) and District Managers (DMs)  
**Selection Criteria:** Representative user base, system familiarity, feedback quality

**Process Steps:**

1. **Participant Identification**
   - Select 3-5 Account Managers representing different territories
   - Select 2-3 District Managers with varying site portfolios
   - Ensure participants have current system experience
   - Consider availability during UAT timeframe

2. **Participant Preparation**
   - Schedule UAT sessions avoiding financial close periods
   - Provide UAT overview and expectations
   - Share system access credentials and environment details
   - Distribute UAT scenario documentation

3. **Communication Strategy**
   - Set clear expectations: focus on feedback, not error detection
   - Emphasize system evaluation and user experience assessment
   - Establish feedback collection methods and timelines
   - Define escalation procedures for critical issues

### Phase 2: UAT Execution

#### 2.1 UAT Session Methodology

**Session Duration:** 2-4 hours per participant  
**Session Format:** Individual guided sessions with observation  
**Documentation:** Real-time feedback capture and issue logging

**Process Steps:**

1. **Session Initiation**
   - Welcome participant and review session objectives
   - Confirm system access and environment readiness
   - Review UAT scenarios and expected outcomes
   - Begin screen recording for later analysis (with permission)

2. **Guided Workflow Execution**
   - **Forecasting Core Workflows:**
     - Site selection and navigation
     - Data entry and modification
     - P&L view interaction and analysis
     - Internal Revenue feature utilization
     - Payroll override functionality testing

3. **Feedback Collection Process**
   - **Real-time Observations:**
     - User navigation patterns and hesitations
     - Interface confusion points
     - Feature discovery and usage patterns
     - Performance perception and response times

   - **Structured Feedback Questions:**
     - "How intuitive is this workflow compared to current processes?"
     - "What would you change about this interface?"
     - "Are there missing features you expected to find?"
     - "How does this compare to your current forecasting methods?"

4. **Issue Documentation**
   - **User Experience Issues:** Interface confusion, workflow inefficiencies
   - **Functional Gaps:** Missing features or incomplete functionality
   - **Performance Concerns:** Slow response times or system delays
   - **Training Needs:** Areas requiring additional user education

#### 2.2 Feedback Analysis and Prioritization

**Responsible Role:** Business Analyst, Product Owner  
**Timeline:** Within 24 hours of session completion  
**Output:** Prioritized improvement backlog

**Process Steps:**

1. **Feedback Categorization**
   - **Critical:** Blocking issues preventing system adoption
   - **High:** Significant user experience improvements
   - **Medium:** Nice-to-have enhancements
   - **Low:** Minor cosmetic or preference items

2. **Impact Assessment**
   - Evaluate feedback frequency across multiple participants
   - Assess implementation effort and complexity
   - Consider business value and user adoption impact
   - Review alignment with product roadmap priorities

3. **Prioritization Matrix**
   - Plot feedback items on impact vs. effort matrix
   - Identify quick wins for immediate implementation
   - Plan major improvements for future sprint cycles
   - Document items for future consideration

### Phase 3: Post-UAT Activities

#### 3.1 Improvement Implementation

**Responsible Role:** Development Team, Product Owner  
**Timeline:** Based on prioritization and sprint planning  
**Process:** Agile development methodology

**Process Steps:**

1. **Sprint Planning Integration**
   - Incorporate high-priority UAT feedback into sprint backlog
   - Estimate effort and assign development resources
   - Define acceptance criteria based on user feedback
   - Plan validation approach with original UAT participants

2. **Implementation Tracking**
   - Monitor development progress against UAT feedback
   - Conduct regular reviews with Product Owner
   - Validate implementations against original user concerns
   - Prepare for follow-up validation sessions

#### 3.2 UAT Validation and Sign-off

**Responsible Role:** Product Owner, UAT Participants  
**Timeline:** Following improvement implementation  
**Output:** UAT completion certification

**Process Steps:**

1. **Validation Session Planning**
   - Schedule follow-up sessions with original participants
   - Focus on implemented improvements and changes
   - Validate resolution of previously identified issues
   - Confirm user satisfaction with modifications

2. **Sign-off Process**
   - Document participant approval of system changes
   - Obtain formal UAT completion certification
   - Identify any remaining concerns or future considerations
   - Plan transition to wider pilot group deployment

## UAT Timing and Scheduling Guidelines

### Optimal Timing Considerations

**Avoid During:**
- Financial close periods (limited participant availability)
- Major system deployments or maintenance windows
- Holiday periods or vacation seasons
- High-stress operational periods

**Optimal Timing:**
- Mid-month periods with stable operational workload
- Following sprint completion with stable feature set
- When participants have dedicated time for thorough testing
- After internal quality assurance completion

### Resource Planning

**Time Allocation:**
- **Product Owner:** 1-2 days preparation, 4-6 hours session facilitation, 1 day analysis
- **Business Analyst:** 2-3 days preparation and documentation, 4-6 hours session support
- **Participants:** 2-4 hours per session, plus preparation time
- **Development Team:** Variable based on feedback implementation requirements

## Success Metrics and Evaluation

### UAT Effectiveness Measures

**Quantitative Metrics:**
- Number of critical issues identified and resolved
- Participant satisfaction scores (1-10 scale)
- Time to complete standard workflows
- System adoption rate post-UAT

**Qualitative Measures:**
- User confidence in system capabilities
- Workflow efficiency improvements
- Feature discoverability and usability
- Overall user experience satisfaction

### Continuous Improvement

**Process Refinement:**
- Regular UAT methodology reviews and updates
- Participant feedback on UAT process itself
- Integration of lessons learned from each UAT cycle
- Alignment with evolving product development practices

## Risk Management and Mitigation

### Common UAT Risks

**Risk:** Participant unavailability during planned sessions  
**Mitigation:** Maintain backup participant list, flexible scheduling

**Risk:** System instability during UAT sessions  
**Mitigation:** Thorough pre-UAT testing, backup environment preparation

**Risk:** Overwhelming feedback volume  
**Mitigation:** Structured feedback collection, clear prioritization criteria

**Risk:** Conflicting feedback from different participants  
**Mitigation:** Facilitated discussion sessions, consensus-building activities
