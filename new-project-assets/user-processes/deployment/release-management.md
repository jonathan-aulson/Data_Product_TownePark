```

#### 4. Deployment Phase

##### Deployment Strategy
- **Blue-Green Deployment**: Zero-downtime deployment approach
- **Rolling Deployment**: Gradual deployment across instances
- **Canary Deployment**: Limited deployment for validation
- **Feature Flags**: Controlled feature activation

##### Deployment Procedures
1. **Pre-Deployment Validation**
