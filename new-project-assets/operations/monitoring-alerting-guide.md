# Monitoring and Alerting Guide

## Overview

This guide provides comprehensive instructions for monitoring and alerting across the Towne Park data platform. It establishes standards for observability, incident detection, and response procedures to ensure optimal system performance and reliability.

## Monitoring Strategy

### Observability Pillars

#### Metrics
- **System Metrics**: CPU, memory, disk, network utilization
- **Application Metrics**: Response times, throughput, error rates
- **Business Metrics**: Transaction volumes, revenue, user engagement
- **Custom Metrics**: Domain-specific KPIs and performance indicators

#### Logs
- **Application Logs**: Structured logging with correlation IDs
- **System Logs**: Infrastructure and platform logs
- **Security Logs**: Authentication, authorization, and audit trails
- **Integration Logs**: API calls, data transfers, and system interactions

#### Traces
- **Distributed Tracing**: End-to-end request tracking across services
- **Performance Tracing**: Detailed performance analysis and bottleneck identification
- **User Journey Tracing**: Complete user interaction flows
- **Business Process Tracing**: Critical business workflow monitoring

## Monitoring Best Practices

### Alerting Best Practices

#### Alert Design Principles
- **Actionable**: Every alert should require a specific action
- **Relevant**: Alerts should indicate real problems, not false positives
- **Timely**: Alerts should fire early enough to prevent impact
- **Clear**: Alert messages should clearly describe the problem and impact

#### Alert Fatigue Prevention
```yaml
AlertFatigue:
  strategies:
    - "Tune thresholds to reduce false positives"
    - "Use alert suppression during maintenance"
    - "Implement alert correlation and grouping"
    - "Regular review and cleanup of alert rules"
  
  metrics:
    - "Alert-to-incident ratio"
    - "Time to acknowledge alerts"
    - "Alert resolution time"
    - "False positive rate"
```

### Dashboard Design Principles

#### Effective Visualization
- **Hierarchy**: Most important information prominently displayed
- **Context**: Provide sufficient context for decision-making
- **Consistency**: Use consistent colors, fonts, and layouts
- **Responsiveness**: Ensure dashboards work on different screen sizes

#### User Experience
```yaml
DashboardUX:
  design_principles:
    - "Mobile-first responsive design"
    - "Intuitive navigation and filtering"
    - "Fast loading times (<3 seconds)"
    - "Accessible design for all users"
  
  customization:
    - "Role-based dashboard views"
    - "Personalized metric preferences"
    - "Custom time range selection"
    - "Bookmark and sharing capabilities"
```

## Monitoring Automation

### Automated Remediation

#### Self-Healing Systems
```yaml

  scenarios:
    service_restart:
      trigger: "Service health check failure"
      action: "Automatic service restart"

    resource_scaling:
      trigger: "High resource utilization"
      action: "Auto-scaling activation"
      validation: "Performance improvement confirmation"
    
    cache_clearing:
      trigger: "Memory pressure alerts"
      action: "Automatic cache cleanup"
      validation: "Memory usage reduction"
  
  safety_measures:
    - "Maximum retry attempts"
    - "Escalation to human operators"
    - "Rollback procedures"
    - "Audit logging of all actions"
```

    grouping: "Related alerts grouped into incidents"
    prioritization: "Business impact-based prioritization"
```

## Reporting and Analytics
