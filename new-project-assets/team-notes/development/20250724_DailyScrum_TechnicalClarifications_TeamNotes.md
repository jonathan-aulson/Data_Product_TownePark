**Decision**: Implement comprehensive error handling with automated recovery
**Rationale**: Ensures system resilience and minimizes manual intervention
**Implementation Details**:
- Circuit breaker pattern for external service calls
- Exponential backoff retry logic
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring
- Automated alerting for critical failures

**Technical Specifications**: [Integration Error Handling Rules](../../business-rules/billing/integration-error-handling-rules.md)

- Added composite indexes for frequently accessed data
- Introduced result caching for repeated calculations
- Configured connection pooling for better resource utilization

**Status**: Performance improved by 60%, monitoring ongoing

### Integration Reliability
**Issue**: Intermittent failures in EDW data synchronization
**Root Cause**: Network timeouts and connection pool exhaustion
**Resolution**:
- Implemented circuit breaker pattern
- Increased connection pool size
- Added retry logic with exponential backoff
- Enhanced monitoring and alerting

**Status**: Reliability improved to 99.5% uptime, continued monitoring

### Data Consistency
**Issue**: Occasional data inconsistencies between systems
**Root Cause**: Race conditions in concurrent data updates
**Resolution**:
- Implemented optimistic concurrency control
- Added data validation checkpoints
- Enhanced error logging and recovery procedures
- Established data reconciliation processes

**Status**: Data consistency issues reduced by 90%, ongoing validation
