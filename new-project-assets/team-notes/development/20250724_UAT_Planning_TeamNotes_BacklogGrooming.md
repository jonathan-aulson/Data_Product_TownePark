# UAT Planning Team Notes - Backlog Grooming Session

## Meeting Overview

**Meeting Date:** June 9, 2025  
**Meeting Type:** Backlog Grooming Session  
**Duration:** Approximately 1 hour  
**Focus Area:** UAT Planning and Feature Milestone Strategy

**Participants:**
- **Jonathan Aulson** - Business Analyst
- **Amy Sowells** - Product Owner  
- **Adam Suarez** - Product Owner
- **Michael Foy** - Team Member

## Key Decisions and Coordination Activities

### 1. UAT Timing Strategy Decision

**Decision ID:** D004  
**Decision Date:** June 9, 2025  
**Decision Owner:** Amy Sowells  
**Status:** Approved

**Team Discussion Summary:**
Jonathan proposed strategic timing adjustment: "Is that to get past this next Sprint would be a pretty good point in time 'cause at that point we've got Internal Revenue finished on the P&L and we've got this override concept on payroll built and so having them actually kind of go through a UAT process might might make sense."

Amy agreed with the strategic approach: "Yeah, it might be better. It sounds like you're suggesting we wait until this next Sprint is released. Right, which might be better because I like I was coming across a lot of issues when I was doing UAT and I have like a whole day devoted to it."

**Team Coordination Outcomes:**
- Operations UAT postponed until after next Sprint release
- Internal Revenue completion on P&L view established as prerequisite
- Payroll override concept completion required before UAT initiation
- Quality improvement prioritized over timeline acceleration

### 2. UAT Participant Strategy Alignment

**Decision ID:** D005  
**Decision Date:** June 9, 2025  
**Decision Owner:** Amy Sowells  
**Status:** Approved

**Team Discussion Summary:**
Amy clarified target audience strategy: "Sure. Definitely like am S and DMS." (Account Managers and District Managers)

She further defined the UAT approach: "Yeah, exactly that way. They're not necessarily like finding errors like hopefully we find most of the errors and they get corrected before. They're more so just viewing it and giving us feedback on the system, yeah."

**Team Coordination Outcomes:**
- Primary UAT participants identified: Account Managers and District Managers
- UAT methodology shifted from error detection to system feedback collection
- Internal team responsibility established for error resolution before Operations UAT
- Wider pilot group planning initiated for post-UAT phase

### 3. System Quality Assessment Coordination

**Issue ID:** I002  
**Risk ID:** R001  
**Assessment Date:** June 9, 2025  
**Status:** Open - Ongoing Resolution

**Team Discussion Summary:**
Jonathan acknowledged current system state: "Yeah, the the point in time which we started UAT with you guys. It's it's still a little rough. I like the idea of having a little more Polish on it before we get the the field involved."

Amy noted resource constraints: "I think on a week from today because, quite frankly, I haven't had a lot of time to do it during close."

**Team Coordination Activities:**
- System quality assessment completed by Amy during testing
- Multiple issues documented and prioritized for resolution
- Resource allocation challenges identified during financial close period
- Quality improvement roadmap established before field exposure

### 4. Claims Forecasting Exploration Coordination

**Exploration Initiative:** Claims Integration Planning  
**Initiative Date:** June 9, 2025  
**Lead:** Amy Sowells  
**Status:** Initial Exploration Phase

**Team Discussion Summary:**
Amy initiated new integration exploration: "One I know we kinda had an open item as it related to client like forecasting claims and I had an initial call with... Like our support person. That's like kind of the liaison between town park and our claim[s]"

**Team Coordination Activities:**
- Insurance liaison contact established for claims integration
- Initial exploration phase initiated for claims forecasting capability
- Integration complexity assessment planned for future sessions
