# Towne Park Forecasting - UAT Planning Decisions and Claims Exploration

## Overview

This document captures critical UAT planning decisions and initial claims forecasting exploration from the June 9, 2025 backlog grooming session. The session focused on optimizing UAT timing, defining participant strategy, and exploring new claims integration opportunities for the forecasting system.

## Meeting Context

**Meeting Date**: June 9, 2025  
**Meeting Type**: Backlog Grooming - Forecasting  
**Duration**: Approximately 1 hour  
**Key Participants**:
- **Amy Sowells** (Product Owner)
- **Adam Suarez** (Product Owner) 
- **Jonathan Aulson** (Business Analyst)
- **Michael Foy** (Development Team)

## Key Decisions Made

### Decision D004: Delay Operations UAT Until After Next Sprint
**Date**: 2025-06-09  
**Status**: Approved  
**Decision Owner**: Amy Sowells  
**Raised By**: Jonathan Aulson

**Context**: Jonathan proposed delaying Operations UAT to achieve better system stability: "Is that to get past this next Sprint would be a pretty good point in time 'cause at that point we've got Internal Revenue finished on the P&L and we've got this override concept on payroll built and so having them actually kind of go through a UAT process might might make sense."

**Amy's Agreement**: "Yeah, it might be better. It sounds like you're suggesting we wait until this next Sprint is released. Right, which might be better because I like I was coming across a lot of issues when I was doing UAT and I have like a whole day devoted to it."

**Decision Details**:
- Operations UAT postponed until after next Sprint release
- Internal Revenue completion on P&L view required before UAT
- Payroll override concept must be built before UAT
- Focus on fixing current issues before field involvement

**Rationale**:
- System currently "rough" for UAT exposure
- Multiple issues discovered during internal testing
- Need for system polish before field user involvement
- Better milestone alignment with feature completion

### Decision D005: Focus Initial UAT on Account Managers and District Managers
**Date**: 2025-06-09  
**Status**: Approved  
**Decision Owner**: Amy Sowells  
**Raised By**: Amy Sowells

**Amy's Direction**: "Sure. Definitely like am S and DMS." (Account Managers and District Managers)

**UAT Approach Clarification**: "Yeah, exactly that way. They're not necessarily like finding errors like hopefully we find most of the errors and they get corrected before. They're more so just viewing it and giving us feedback on the system, yeah."

**Decision Details**:
- Primary UAT participants: Account Managers and District Managers
- UAT focus shifted from error detection to system feedback
- Internal team to resolve errors before Operations UAT
- Wider pilot group planned after initial UAT

**Strategic Benefits**:
- Targeted feedback from key user roles
- Reduced complexity in initial UAT phase
- Quality assurance handled internally first
- Structured rollout approach

## Current Issues and Risks

### Issue I002: Multiple UAT Issues During Close Period
**Date**: 2025-06-09  
**Status**: Open  
**Affected Features**: Multiple system components  
**Raised By**: Amy Sowells  
**Resolution Owner**: Development Team

**Issue Description**: Amy encountered multiple issues during UAT testing, particularly during the financial close period when time is limited.

**Impact Assessment**:
- System readiness concerns for field UAT
- Time constraints during critical business periods
- Quality concerns affecting UAT timeline

### Risk R001: Limited UAT Time During Financial Close
**Date**: 2025-06-09  
**Status**: Open  
**Risk Owner**: Amy Sowells  
**Mitigation Strategy**: Schedule UAT outside close periods

**Risk Details**: "I think on a week from today because, quite frankly, I haven't had a lot of time to do it during close."

**Mitigation Approaches**:
- Schedule UAT activities outside financial close windows
- Allocate dedicated UAT time blocks
- Coordinate UAT timing with business calendar
- Ensure adequate resource allocation for testing

## Claims Forecasting Exploration

### Initial Claims Integration Investigation
**Date**: 2025-06-09  
**Status**: Exploration Phase  
**Lead**: Amy Sowells  
**Integration Points**: Claims System, Insurance Data

**Amy's Initiative**: "One I know we kinda had an open item as it related to client like forecasting claims and I had an initial call with... Like our support person. That's like kind of the liaison between town park and our claim[s]"

**Exploration Scope**:
- Initial contact established with insurance liaison
- Claims forecasting integration requirements gathering
- Integration complexity assessment needed
- Potential new feature for forecasting system

**Next Steps Required**:
- Define claims data requirements
- Assess integration complexity
- Determine technical feasibility
- Plan implementation approach

## UAT Milestone Requirements

### Pre-UAT Completion Criteria
Based on the decisions made, the following features must be completed before Operations UAT:

1. **Internal Revenue Feature**:
   - Complete implementation on P&L view
   - Full integration testing completed
   - Quality assurance validation passed

2. **Payroll Override Concept**:
   - Override functionality built and tested
   - Business rule validation completed
   - User interface finalized

3. **System Polish Requirements**:
   - Current UAT issues resolved
   - System stability improvements implemented
   - Performance optimization completed

### UAT Readiness Assessment
**Current System State**: "Still a little rough" for field UAT  
**Required Polish Level**: Production-ready for Account Manager and District Manager feedback  
**Quality Gate**: Internal team error resolution before field exposure

## Integration Planning Notes

### Claims System Integration
**Integration Type**: External system connection  
**Data Source**: Insurance claims data  
**Complexity**: To be determined through liaison discussions  
**Timeline**: Exploration phase, no committed timeline

**Technical Considerations**:
- Data format and structure requirements
- Real-time vs. batch integration approach
- Security and compliance requirements
- Error handling and data validation

### P&L View Integration
**Current Status**: Internal Revenue feature in development  
**Completion Target**: Before next UAT milestone  
**Integration Points**: Forecasting system, revenue calculations  
**Dependencies**: Payroll override concept completion

## Team Coordination Notes

### Product Owner Alignment
- Amy Sowells and Adam Suarez both present and aligned on UAT strategy
- Clear ownership established for UAT decisions
- Coordinated approach to feature prioritization

### Development Team Coordination
- Michael Foy representing development perspective
- Technical feasibility considerations incorporated
- Implementation timeline alignment with UAT goals

### Business Analysis Support

## Code Validation Report
**Last Validated**: 2025-07-24  
**Validation Scope**: Workflow Processes, Technical Configuration  

### Validation Summary
- ‚ùì **Incomplete Documentation**: UAT workflow processes not yet validated against Power Platform workflows
- üîç **Requires Review**: Claims integration points need validation against existing connectors
- ‚ùì **Incomplete Documentation**: Internal Revenue and Payroll Override features need code validation

### Validation Opportunities Identified
1. **UAT Process Workflows**: May correspond to Power Platform workflow implementations
2. **Claims Integration**: Should validate against existing connector configurations
3. **Internal Revenue Feature**: Validate against P&L view implementations
4. **Payroll Override**: Validate against payroll calculation logic

### Code File References
- **Workflow Files**: To be analyzed in `Towne-Park-Billing-Source-Code/Towne-Park-Billing-PA-Solution/BillingSystem/Workflows/`
- **Formula Files**: To be analyzed in `Towne-Park-Billing-Source-Code/Towne-Park-Billing-PA-Solution/BillingSystem/Formulas/`
- **Connector Files**: To be analyzed across Power Apps solutions

### Validation Methodology
- **Source Code Repositories Analyzed**: Pending - requires specific feature implementation analysis
- **Code Copy Date**: Current as of transformation date
- **Validation Approach**: Direct file analysis planned for completed features
- **Limitations**: Features still in development, validation pending completion

### Recommended Validation Actions
1. Validate UAT process against Power Platform workflow definitions once features are completed
2. Analyze claims integration requirements against existing connector patterns
3. Cross-reference Internal Revenue implementation with P&L view code
4. Validate Payroll Override logic against existing payroll calculation formulas
