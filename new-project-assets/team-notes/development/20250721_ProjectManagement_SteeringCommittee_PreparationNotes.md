**Participants**: Jonathan Aulson, Amy Sowells, Jim Boyer, Michael Foy  
**Purpose**: Steering committee presentation preparation and project status review

## Project Status Summary

### Overall Project Health
- **Status**: üü¢ **GREEN** - Project on track
- **Milestone Progress**: On schedule for both remaining milestones before pilot
- **Feature Completion**: Several features completed since last steering committee call
- **Risk Level**: Manageable with identified mitigation strategies

### Completed Features Since Last Update
- Multiple sprint features delivered successfully
- Infrastructure and security components ahead of schedule
- User-facing features prioritized and in progress

### Upcoming Features
- **Current Sprint**: Active feature development
- **Next Sprint**: Planned feature set identified
- **Pre-Pilot**: Additional features beyond current capacity

## Milestone Status and Timeline

### Milestone 1: Infrastructure and Security Completion
- **Status**: ‚úÖ **ON TRACK**
- **Progress**: Ahead of schedule due to early start
- **Completion**: Expected to complete all infrastructure and security requirements

### Milestone 2: User Features Completion
- **Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **ON TRACK WITH ASTERISK**
- **Note**: Asterisk indicates prioritization of user-facing features
- **Scope**: Not all user features included to avoid misleading completion status
- **Strategy**: Focus on highest priority user features for pilot

### Pre-Pilot Timeline
- **Steering Committee Meetings**: One more before pilot launch
- **Feature Scope**: More features available than presentation time allows
- **Prioritization**: User-facing features moved up in priority

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### Risk 1: Data Gateway Hardening
- **Risk Level**: üü° **MEDIUM**
- **Description**: Data gateway needs hardening for production scaling
- **Current Status**: In discussion with Guy's team
- **Mitigation**: 
  - Implementation planned on Datamart servers
  - Scheduled call at 2:00 PM for ETA confirmation
  - Datamart servers not yet in place

### Risk 2: Monitoring and Alerting
- **Risk Level**: üü° **MEDIUM**
- **Description**: Monitoring gaps for systems outside IT control
- **Affected Systems**:
  - Great Plains application and Power Bill integration
  - Azure components outside data team control
  - ETL process health monitoring
- **Current Status**: List provided to Guy's team for monitoring implementation
- **Business Impact**: Health visibility for critical integrations

### Risk 3: ETL Team Availability
- **Risk Level**: üü° **MEDIUM**
- **Description**: ETL build-out team availability during planned window
- **Current Status**: Juan Pascual out this week
- **Next Steps**: Confirm availability when Juan returns
- **Timeline Impact**: Could affect ETL implementation schedule

### Risk 4: Role-Based Access Control (Resolved)
- **Risk Level**: ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**
- **Description**: Job title changes and new position access
- **Resolution**: 
  - Job management panel identifies new job codes
  - Labor allocation report provides complete user list
  - Job title configuration enables proper access control
- **DOO Access**: Confirmed access to all sites and districts (consistent with claims system approach)

## Infrastructure and Security Requirements

### Data Gateway Implementation
- **Requirement**: Production-ready data gateway
- **Implementation**: Datamart server deployment
- **Timeline**: Pending ETA from infrastructure team
- **Dependencies**: Datamart server availability

### Monitoring Coverage Gaps
- **Great Plains Integration**: Health monitoring for GP-Power Bill connection
- **Azure Components**: Monitoring for components outside data team access
- **ETL Processes**: Health metrics for data integration processes
- **Resolution**: Coordination with Guy's team for monitoring implementation

### Access Control Management
- **New Job Codes**: Automatic detection and configuration workflow
- **Role Assignment**: Job title-based access control
- **User Coverage**: Complete user identification through labor allocation report
- **DOO Role**: Company-wide access consistent with reporting requirements

## Decision Points and Action Items

### Open Decision: Feature Roadmap Review
- **Context**: Prioritized certain features for pilot development
- **Requirement**: Review roadmap with steering committee
- **Presentation**: Create slide showing feature prioritization changes
- **Content**: Show completed, in-progress, and post-pilot features

### Action Items from Meeting

#### Immediate Actions (Jonathan)
1. **Guy Meeting**: Connect at 2:00 PM for data gateway and monitoring updates
2. **Steering Committee Prep**: Finalize presentation with roadmap changes
3. **Status Update**: Provide 3:30 PM update to Amy and Michael

#### Ongoing Actions (Amy)
1. **Job Profile Mapping**: Completed and sent back this morning
2. **10% Sites Configuration**: Starting tomorrow, complete by end of month
3. **Pilot Site Setup**: Configure sites as closely as possible with available features

#### Follow-up Actions (Team)
1. **ETL Confirmation**: Confirm team availability when Juan returns
2. **Risk Escalation**: Escalate to Brian and Mike if no movement on infrastructure items
3. **Backlog Planning**: Review stories for pilot development and next sprint

## Change Management and Rollout Strategy

### Rollout Communication Approach
- **Previous**: Focused on rollout start dates
- **Updated**: Emphasize rollout completion dates
- **Rationale**: Aligns with change management plan perspective
- **Benefit**: Clearer timeline communication for stakeholders

### Feature Work Completion
- **Status**: On track to complete planned feature list
- **Scope**: Focused on pilot-ready functionality
- **Quality**: Emphasis on production-ready features over quantity

## Technical Considerations

### Hourly Employee Allocation Discussion
- **Question**: Why hourly employees have allocated costs
- **Expectation**: Hours clocked determine allocation location
- **Clarification Needed**: Understanding of current allocation methodology
- **Impact**: Affects payroll forecasting accuracy

### System Integration Health
- **Great Plains**: Critical for billing system integration
- **Power Bill**: Dependent on Great Plains connectivity
