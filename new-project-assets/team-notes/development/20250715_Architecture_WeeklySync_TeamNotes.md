# Towne Park Forecasting - Architecture Weekly Sync

## Meeting Overview

**Date**: July 15, 2025  
**Time**: Not specified  
**Duration**: 17 minutes 12 seconds  
**Meeting Type**: Architecture Weekly Synchronization  
**Primary Purpose**: Review technical progress, coordinate infrastructure changes, and plan non-functional requirements implementation

## Participants

| Name | Role | Organization |
|------|------|--------------|
| Jonathan Aulson | Project Manager | Towne Park |
| Christopher Thompson | Developer | Towne Park |
| Cesar Figueroa | Technical Architect | Towne Park |

## Key Technical Discussions

### 1. AI-Assisted Development and Debugging

#### Payroll Cost Component Bug Resolution
**Developer**: Christopher Thompson  
**Challenge**: Complex Power Platform component causing issues  
**Problem**: Default power component behavior causing unexpected results

#### AI-Assisted Solution Approach
**Tool Used**: Claude Sonnet Chat Model  
**Strategy**: 
- Input entire component code into AI system
- Request solution in small, manageable sections
- Avoid overwhelming AI with complete component output

**Initial Attempt Issues**:
- First attempt: AI tried to output entire component at once
- Result: System froze due to complexity
- Solution: Break down into smaller sections for processing

**Current Status**: 
- Solution approach working effectively
- Testing output for correctness
- Mathematical validation in progress (June data verification)
- Multitasking approach being used

#### Technical Implementation Notes
**Component Complexity**: Described as "beast" level complexity  
**AI Tool Limitation**: Cannot handle complete large component analysis  
**Successful Strategy**: Sectioned approach with specific problem definition  
**Validation Process**: Manual verification of AI-generated solutions

### 2. Non-Functional Requirements Planning

#### Sprint 32 Completion Deadline
**Target Date**: August 26, 2025  
**Requirement**: All non-functional features must be implemented by end of Sprint 32  
**Priority Level**: Critical for project completion

#### Current Non-Functional Features Status
**Assessment**: Most features not super urgent  
**Exception**: Replication process with backup (high priority)  
**Purpose**: Avoid issues and enable recovery capabilities  
**Timeline**: Must be completed within Sprint 32 timeframe

#### Implementation Strategy
**Approach**: Systematic completion of non-functional requirements  
**Focus**: Backup and recovery processes as highest priority  
**Resource Allocation**: Dedicated time in final sprint phases

### 3. Infrastructure Migration Requirements

#### Database Replication Changes
**Previous Requirement**: Node one to node two replication  
**Updated Requirement**: Node two to datamart replication  
**Reason**: Requirements changed during development

#### New Infrastructure Architecture
**Target Environment**: 
- Datamart production server
- TPDW development server
- Two separate server instances required

**Current Limitations**:
- No gateways installed yet
- Datamart not accessible currently
- Cannot perform migration until infrastructure ready

#### Implementation Blockers
**Gateway Installation**: Required before migration possible  
**Access Issues**: Datamart accessibility not established  
**Timeline Dependency**: Infrastructure team coordination needed

### 4. Infrastructure as Code Development

#### Bicep Template Creation
**Tool Development**: Bot created to assist with Bicep object creation  
**Estimated Time**: 2 hours for complete activity  
**Scope**: Create all necessary Bicep objects for infrastructure  
**Status**: Ready for implementation when infrastructure available

#### Automation Benefits
**Efficiency**: Automated object creation reduces manual effort  
**Consistency**: Standardized infrastructure deployment  
**Repeatability**: Reliable deployment across environments

### 5. IT Huddle Coordination

#### Timeline Discussion Requirement
**Forum**: Next IT huddle meeting  
**Topic**: Infrastructure migration timeline  
**Purpose**: Coordinate datamart availability and gateway installation  
**Stakeholders**: Infrastructure team, project team

#### Coordination Needs
**Infrastructure Team**: Gateway installation timeline  
**Project Team**: Migration readiness and requirements  
**Timeline Alignment**: Sprint 32 completion deadline

## Action Items Summary

| Item | Owner | Due Date | Status |
|------|-------|----------|---------|
| Complete payroll cost component debugging | Christopher Thompson | In progress | Active |
| Validate AI-generated solution with June data | Christopher Thompson | In progress | Active |
| Address infrastructure timeline in IT huddle | Cesar Figueroa | Next IT huddle | Pending |
| Complete non-functional requirements | Cesar Figueroa | August 26, 2025 | Pending |
| Implement backup/replication process | Cesar Figueroa | Sprint 32 | High Priority |
| Create Bicep infrastructure objects | Cesar Figueroa | When infrastructure ready | Ready |

## Technical Decisions Made

1. **AI-Assisted Development**: Approved sectioned approach for complex component debugging
2. **Infrastructure Migration**: Updated from node-to-node to node-to-datamart architecture
3. **Sprint 32 Priority**: Non-functional requirements completion confirmed as critical
4. **Backup Process**: Identified as highest priority non-functional requirement

## Infrastructure Requirements

### Current State
- Node two to datamart migration required
- Gateway installation pending
- Datamart accessibility not established
- Infrastructure coordination needed

### Target State
- Datamart production server operational
- TPDW development server available
- Gateway connectivity established
- Backup and replication processes active

### Dependencies
- Infrastructure team gateway installation
- Datamart server accessibility
- IT huddle coordination and timeline agreement

## Development Process Innovations

### AI-Assisted Debugging
**Benefits**:
- Complex component analysis capability
- Rapid solution generation
- Reduced debugging time
- Systematic problem-solving approach

**Limitations**:
- Cannot handle complete large components
- Requires sectioned input approach
- Manual validation still required
- Output verification necessary

**Best Practices Established**:
- Break complex problems into smaller sections
- Provide specific problem definitions to AI
- Validate all AI-generated solutions manually
- Use iterative approach for complex components

## Sprint Planning Notes

### Sprint 32 Focus Areas
1. **Non-Functional Requirements**: Complete all outstanding items
2. **Infrastructure Migration**: Execute node-to-datamart transition
3. **Backup/Recovery**: Implement replication processes
4. **Infrastructure as Code**: Deploy Bicep templates

### Timeline Constraints
- **Hard Deadline**: August 26, 2025
- **Critical Path**: Infrastructure availability
- **Dependencies**: IT team coordination
- **Priority**: Backup/recovery processes
