## Technical Discussions and Decisions

### Architecture Decisions

#### Forecasting Data Model
**Decision**: Implement hybrid approach with both relational and document storage
**Rationale**: Supports structured forecasting data while allowing flexible metadata storage
**Implementation**: 
- Core forecasting data in SQL Server tables
- Configuration and user preferences in JSON documents
- Caching layer for frequently accessed calculations

**Impact**: Improved performance and flexibility for future enhancements

#### Integration Strategy
**Decision**: Use event-driven architecture for real-time data synchronization
**Rationale**: Ensures data consistency across systems while maintaining performance
**Implementation**:
- Message queue for asynchronous processing
- Event sourcing for audit trail and data recovery
- Circuit breaker pattern for external service resilience

**Impact**: Enhanced system reliability and scalability

### Technical Challenges and Solutions

#### Performance Optimization
**Challenge**: Forecasting calculations taking longer than acceptable for large datasets
**Root Cause**: Inefficient query patterns and lack of proper indexing
**Solution**: 
- Implement query optimization strategies
- Add composite indexes for frequently accessed data
- Introduce result caching for repeated calculations
- Optimize database connection pooling

**Status**: Implementation in progress, testing scheduled for tomorrow

#### Integration Complexity
**Challenge**: Multiple external systems with different API patterns and data formats
**Root Cause**: Lack of standardized integration approach
**Solution**:
- Develop unified integration framework
- Implement adapter pattern for different API types
- Create standardized data transformation pipeline
- Establish comprehensive error handling and retry logic

**Status**: Framework design complete, implementation 60% complete

#### User Experience Consistency
**Challenge**: Ensuring consistent user experience across different forecasting workflows
**Root Cause**: Multiple developers working on different UI components
**Solution**:
- Establish comprehensive UI component library
- Implement design system with standardized patterns
- Create shared validation and error handling components
- Conduct regular UX review sessions

**Status**: Component library 80% complete, integration ongoing
