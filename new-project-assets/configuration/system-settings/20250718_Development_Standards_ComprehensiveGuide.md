## Git Workflow and Branch Management

### Branch Structure and Rules

#### Hierarchical Branch Model
```
develop ‚Üê feature/* ‚Üê task/*
```

#### Critical Branch Rules
- üö´ **NEVER create PRs targeting `master` branch**
- ‚úÖ **Maximum target**: `develop` branch for all developer PRs
- **Task branches** (`task/*`): Target parent feature branch, link Task work items
- **Feature branches** (`feature/*`): Target `develop` branch, link User Story work items

#### Branch Naming Conventions
- **Task branches**: `task/[task-id]-[brief-description]`
- **Feature branches**: `feature/[user-story-id]-[brief-description]`

### Commit Message Standards

Follow [Conventional Commits 1.0.0](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

#### Commit Types
- `feat`: New feature implementation
- `fix`: Bug fix resolution
- `refactor`: Code refactoring without functionality changes
- `test`: Adding or modifying tests
- `docs`: Documentation updates
- `style`: Code formatting changes (no logic changes)
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks and build updates

#### Commit Message Format
```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

#### Examples
```
feat(billing): add revenue share calculation logic
fix(auth): resolve token expiration handling
refactor(contracts): extract common validation logic
test(forecasting): add unit tests for data aggregation
docs(api): update endpoint documentation
```

## Code Quality Standards

### General Development Principles

#### Core Principles
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Eliminate code duplication
- **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**: Favor simple solutions
- **YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)**: Avoid premature optimization
- **Single Responsibility**: Each component/function has one clear purpose
- **Maintainability**: Write code for future developers
- **Readability**: Code should be self-documenting

#### Design Patterns
- Use abstraction and interfaces for decoupling
- Prioritize modular, reusable, and testable code
- Apply dependency injection for loose coupling
- Implement proper error handling and logging

### Frontend Development Standards

#### Project Structure
```
/src/
  /pages/          # Route-based page components
  /components/     # Reusable UI components and feature-specific logic
  /hooks/          # Custom React hooks
  /context/        # React Context providers
  /types/          # TypeScript type definitions
  /utils/          # Utility functions
```

#### Component Guidelines
- **Component Type**: Use functional components exclusively
- **TypeScript**: All components must have TypeScript interfaces for props
- **Hooks**: Leverage React hooks for state and lifecycle management
- **Props Interface**: Define clear, typed interfaces for all component props

#### UI Development Standards
- **Component Library**: Use ShadCN components with minimal styling customization
- **Custom Styles**: Apply Tailwind CSS for additional styling needs
- **Design System**: Follow atomic design principles for component organization
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure mobile-first responsive design approach

#### State Management Strategy
- **Global State**: Use React Context for application-wide state
- **Local State**: Keep component-specific state within components
- **Performance**: Avoid unnecessary re-renders through proper state design
- **State Structure**: Design state for predictability and maintainability

#### Testing Requirements
- **Framework**: Jest and React Testing Library
- **Coverage**: Test both happy paths and edge cases
- **Structure**: Test files should mirror component structure
- **Naming**: Use descriptive test names that explain behavior

#### Interactive Element Naming
Use `data-qa-id` attributes with pattern: `[component-type]-[iteration/index]-[specific-action]`

**Examples:**
- Buttons: `data-qa-id="button-revenue-management-submit"`
- Inputs: `data-qa-id="input-login-email"`
- Switches: `data-qa-id="switch-revenue-management-enabled"`
- Dropdowns: `data-qa-id="dropdown-user-role"`

### Backend Development Standards

#### 4-Layer Architecture Pattern

Follow this mandatory 4-layer architecture for all features:

##### 1. Repository Layer (`Data/Impl/`)
**Purpose**: Handle direct data access operations
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Direct data access to Dataverse and SQL databases
  - Accept and return domain models (e.g., `bs_Entity`)
  - Inject `IDataverseService` for `IOrganizationService` access
- **Restrictions**:
  - No business logic implementation
  - Only data access operations

##### 2. Service Layer (`Services/Impl/`)
**Purpose**: Contain business logic and orchestration
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Business logic implementation
  - Data validation and business rule enforcement
  - Orchestration of multiple repository operations
  - Work with Value Objects (VOs)
- **Dependencies**:
  - Use repositories for all data operations
  - Apply business rules and validation logic

##### 3. Adapter Layer (`Adapters/Impl/` and `Adapters/Mappers/`)
**Purpose**: Bridge between services and external interfaces
- **Service Adapters** (`Adapters/Impl/`):
  - Accept and return DTOs
  - Delegate business operations to services
  - Keep adapters thin with no business logic
- **Mappers** (`Adapters/Mappers/`):
  - Use Mapperly for all VO ‚Üî DTO mapping
  - Handle object transformation between layers

##### 4. Function/API Layer (`Functions/`)
**Purpose**: Expose HTTP endpoints via Azure Functions
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Parse and validate HTTP input
  - Call appropriate service adapters
  - Return HTTP responses with DTOs
- **Restrictions**:
  - No business logic implementation
  - No direct data access operations

#### Data Flow Architecture
```
Dataverse/EDW ‚Üí [Mapperly] ‚Üí VO ‚Üí [Mapperly] ‚Üí DTO ‚Üí API ‚Üí Frontend Interface ‚Üí UI
```

#### Mapping Requirements

##### Mandatory Mapperly Usage
- **REQUIREMENT**: Use [Mapperly](https://mapperly.riok.app/) for ALL object mappings
- **PROHIBITION**: No manual mapping code or alternative mapping libraries
- **Implementation**: Create dedicated mapper classes per feature (e.g., `ContractMapper`)

##### Object Model Organization
- **Value Objects (VOs)**: Located in `api/src/Models/Vo/` with namespace `api.Models.Vo`
- **Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)**: Located in `api/src/Models/Dto/` with namespace `api.Models.Dto`
- **Mapper Classes**: Feature-specific mappers in `Adapters/Mappers/`

#### Namespace Standards
- **Production Code**: `api` namespace (e.g., `api.Services.Impl`, `api.Data.Impl`)
- **Test Code**: `BackendTests` namespace (e.g., `BackendTests.Services`, `BackendTests.Data`)

#### Testing Strategy
- **Framework**: xUnit and Moq for testing
- **Location**: Backend tests in `api/tests/` directory
- **Coverage**: Write unit tests for each layer with appropriate mocking
- **Isolation**: Test each layer independently with proper dependency mocking

#### Dependency Injection Guidelines
- **Constructor Injection**: Use constructor injection for all dependencies
- **Service Adapters**: Instantiate mappers directly (don't inject mappers)
- **Interface Design**: Design interfaces for testability and loose coupling

## Authentication and Authorization

### Static Web App Configuration

#### Route-Based Security
- **Public Routes**:
  - `/`: Login page (anonymous access allowed)
- **Protected Routes**:
  - `/billing/*`: Requires authentication
  - `/api/*`: Requires authentication
- **Admin Routes**: Use `.auth/me` endpoint for role validation

#### Authentication Flow
1. User accesses protected route
2. System redirects to authentication provider
3. Upon successful authentication, user gains access to authorized routes
4. Role-based access control applied for admin functions

## Business Domain Knowledge
