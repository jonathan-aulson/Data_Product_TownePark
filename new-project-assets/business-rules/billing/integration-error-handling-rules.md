# Integration Error Handling Business Rules

## Overview

This document defines comprehensive business rules governing error handling procedures for billing system integrations, including error classification, resolution protocols, escalation procedures, and quality assurance requirements.

## Rule Definitions

### Rule IEH-001: Error Classification Standards
**Rule Name**: Error Classification Standards  
**Description**: All integration errors must be classified according to standardized categories and severity levels  
**Applies To**: All billing system integrations  
**Calculation Formula**: Error Severity Score = (Impact Level × Frequency) + Urgency Factor  
**Examples**:
- Critical: Payment processing failures, data corruption
- High: Invoice generation delays, customer data sync issues
- Medium: Report generation delays, non-critical data validation failures
- Low: Cosmetic issues, minor performance degradation
**Source**: Integration Standards Document v2.1, approved 2025-06-15  
**Implementation**: Automated error classification system with manual override capability  
**Edge Cases**:
- Cascading failures may require severity escalation
- Business-critical periods may increase severity classification

### Rule IEH-002: Automatic Retry Logic
**Rule Name**: Automatic Retry Logic  
**Description**: Integration errors must follow standardized retry patterns based on error type and severity  
**Applies To**: All transient integration errors  
**Calculation Formula**: Retry Delay = Base Delay × (Backoff Multiplier ^ Attempt Number)  
**Examples**:
- Network timeouts: 3 retries with exponential backoff (30s, 60s, 120s)
- Rate limiting: 5 retries with linear backoff (60s intervals)
- Service unavailable: 3 retries with exponential backoff (15s, 30s, 60s)
**Source**: Error Handling Standards v1.4, approved 2025-05-20  
**Implementation**: Configurable retry engine with per-error-type settings  
**Edge Cases**:
- Critical business periods may require faster retry intervals
- Downstream system maintenance may require retry suspension

### Rule IEH-003: Error Notification Requirements
**Rule Name**: Error Notification Requirements  
**Description**: Error notifications must be sent according to severity level and stakeholder roles  
**Applies To**: All integration errors above defined thresholds  
**Calculation Formula**: Notification Urgency = (Error Severity × Business Impact) + Time Sensitivity  
**Examples**:
- Critical errors: Immediate notification to on-call team and management
- High errors: 15-minute notification to support team and system administrators
- Medium errors: Hourly digest to support team
- Low errors: Daily summary report
**Source**: Incident Management Policy v2.0, approved 2025-04-10  
**Implementation**: Multi-channel notification system with escalation rules  
**Edge Cases**:
- After-hours notifications may use different channels
- Holiday periods may require adjusted notification procedures

### Rule IEH-004: Data Integrity Validation
**Rule Name**: Data Integrity Validation  
**Description**: All integration errors must trigger data integrity validation procedures  
**Applies To**: Errors affecting data consistency or accuracy  
**Calculation Formula**: Integrity Risk Score = (Data Volume Affected × Criticality) + Recovery Complexity  
**Examples**:
- Invoice data corruption: Full data validation and reconciliation required
- Customer record sync failure: Incremental validation and correction
- Report generation error: Data validation for affected time period
**Source**: Data Quality Standards v1.5, approved 2025-03-25  
**Implementation**: Automated data validation workflows with manual verification checkpoints  
**Edge Cases**:
- Large data volumes may require phased validation
- Real-time systems may need immediate rollback procedures

### Rule IEH-005: Error Resolution Timeframes
**Rule Name**: Error Resolution Timeframes  
**Description**: Integration errors must be resolved within defined Service Level Agreements (SLAs)  
**Applies To**: All integration errors with defined severity levels  
**Calculation Formula**: SLA Compliance = (Errors Resolved Within SLA / Total Errors) × 100, Target ≥ 95%  
**Examples**:
- Critical errors: 2 hours maximum resolution time
- High errors: 8 hours maximum resolution time
- Medium errors: 24 hours maximum resolution time
- Low errors: 72 hours maximum resolution time
**Source**: Service Level Agreement Document v3.0, approved 2025-02-15  
**Implementation**: SLA tracking system with automated escalation triggers  
**Edge Cases**:
- Complex errors may require SLA extension with management approval
- Vendor dependencies may affect resolution timeframes

### Rule IEH-006: Escalation Procedures
**Rule Name**: Escalation Procedures  
**Description**: Unresolved errors must follow defined escalation paths based on time and severity  
**Applies To**: All integration errors exceeding initial resolution timeframes  
**Calculation Formula**: Escalation Level = (Time Elapsed / SLA Target) + Severity Multiplier  
**Examples**:
- Level 1: Support team (0-2 hours for critical, 0-4 hours for high)
- Level 2: System administrators and team leads (2-4 hours for critical, 4-8 hours for high)
- Level 3: Management and vendor escalation (4+ hours for critical, 8+ hours for high)
**Source**: Escalation Matrix v1.3, approved 2025-01-30  
**Implementation**: Automated escalation system with manual override capability  
**Edge Cases**:
- Weekend and holiday escalations may follow modified procedures
- Vendor availability may affect escalation timing

### Rule IEH-007: Root Cause Analysis Requirements
**Rule Name**: Root Cause Analysis Requirements  
**Description**: Critical and recurring errors must undergo formal root cause analysis  
**Applies To**: Critical errors and errors occurring more than 3 times in 30 days  
**Calculation Formula**: RCA Priority = (Error Frequency × Impact Score) + Business Risk Factor  
**Examples**:
- Critical payment processing failure: Immediate RCA required
- Recurring invoice generation delays: RCA within 48 hours
- Multiple customer data sync issues: RCA within 72 hours
**Source**: Quality Improvement Process v2.2, approved 2025-06-01  
**Implementation**: RCA workflow system with template and tracking capabilities  
**Edge Cases**:
- Complex multi-system issues may require extended RCA timeframes
- Vendor-related issues may require joint RCA procedures

### Rule IEH-008: Error Documentation Standards
**Rule Name**: Error Documentation Standards  
**Description**: All integration errors must be documented with standardized information and resolution details  
**Applies To**: All integration errors regardless of severity  
**Calculation Formula**: Documentation Completeness = (Required Fields Completed / Total Required Fields) × 100, Target = 100%  
**Examples**:
- Error description, timestamp, affected systems, resolution steps
- Impact assessment, root cause, preventive measures
- Stakeholder notifications, escalation history, lessons learned
**Source**: Documentation Standards v1.4, approved 2025-05-10  
**Implementation**: Structured error logging system with mandatory field validation  
**Edge Cases**:
- Emergency situations may allow abbreviated initial documentation with follow-up completion
- Sensitive errors may require restricted access documentation
