# Claims Forecasting Business Rules

## Overview

This document establishes the business rules governing claims forecasting integration within Towne Park's forecasting system, defining requirements for insurance data integration, claims prediction methodology, and system integration criteria.

## Claims Forecasting Framework

### 1. Claims Integration Requirements

#### 1.1 Insurance System Integration Criteria

**Integration Scope:** Claims forecasting capability within existing forecasting system  
**Primary Integration Point:** Insurance claims system via designated liaison  
**Data Flow Direction:** Bidirectional - claims data input, forecast output

**Business Rules:**

**BR-CF-001: Insurance Liaison Requirement**
- All claims forecasting integration must be coordinated through designated insurance liaison
- Insurance liaison serves as primary contact for claims system requirements
- Integration planning requires insurance liaison approval and validation
- Claims data access must comply with insurance system security protocols

**BR-CF-002: Claims Data Integration Standards**
- Claims data must be integrated through established API frameworks
- Data integration must maintain real-time or near-real-time synchronization
- Claims data must include historical patterns for forecasting accuracy
- Integration must support both individual claim tracking and aggregate forecasting

**BR-CF-003: System Compatibility Requirements**
- Claims forecasting must integrate seamlessly with existing P&L view functionality
- Claims data must be compatible with current forecasting calculation engine
- Integration must not impact existing forecasting system performance
- Claims forecasting must support existing user role and permission structure

#### 1.2 Claims Data Requirements

**Data Categories:** Historical claims, active claims, claims trends, risk factors  
**Data Frequency:** Real-time updates for active claims, daily aggregation for forecasting  
**Data Retention:** Minimum 3 years historical data for trend analysis

**Business Rules:**

**BR-CF-004: Historical Claims Data Standards**
- Minimum 36 months of historical claims data required for baseline forecasting
- Historical data must include claim amounts, claim types, resolution timeframes
- Data must be categorized by site, region, and claim category
- Historical trends must be validated for accuracy and completeness

**BR-CF-005: Active Claims Tracking Requirements**
- Active claims must be updated in real-time or within 24 hours
- Claims status changes must trigger forecast recalculation
- Active claims must include estimated resolution amounts and timeframes
- Claims must be linked to specific customer sites and operational periods

**BR-CF-006: Claims Categorization Standards**
- Claims must be categorized by type: liability, property, workers compensation, other
- Each category must have distinct forecasting algorithms and risk factors
- Claims must be classified by severity: minor, moderate, major, catastrophic
- Categorization must align with insurance system classification standards

### 2. Forecasting Methodology Rules

#### 2.1 Claims Prediction Algorithms

**Forecasting Approach:** Statistical modeling with trend analysis and risk factor adjustment  
**Prediction Horizon:** 12-month rolling forecast with quarterly updates  
**Accuracy Targets:** ±15% variance for aggregate claims, ±25% for individual site predictions

**Business Rules:**

**BR-CF-007: Forecasting Calculation Standards**
- Claims forecasting must utilize minimum 24 months of historical data
- Forecasting algorithms must account for seasonal variations and trends
- Predictions must be adjusted for known risk factors and operational changes
- Forecasting must provide confidence intervals and variance analysis

**BR-CF-008: Risk Factor Integration**
- Site-specific risk factors must be incorporated into claims forecasting
- Operational changes (new sites, service modifications) must trigger forecast updates
- Industry trends and external factors must be considered in forecasting models
- Risk factor weights must be validated and updated quarterly

**BR-CF-009: Forecast Validation Requirements**
- Claims forecasts must be validated against actual claims monthly
- Variance analysis must be performed and documented for accuracy tracking
- Forecasting models must be recalibrated when variance exceeds ±20%
- Validation results must be reported to insurance liaison and product owners

#### 2.2 Integration with Financial Forecasting

**Integration Scope:** Claims forecasting integrated with overall P&L forecasting  
**Financial Impact:** Claims costs included in operational expense forecasting  
**Reporting Integration:** Claims forecasts included in standard financial reports

**Business Rules:**

**BR-CF-010: P&L Integration Standards**
- Claims forecasts must be integrated into P&L view as separate expense category
- Claims costs must be allocated to appropriate cost centers and sites
- Claims forecasting must support budget vs. actual variance analysis
- Integration must maintain existing P&L calculation accuracy and performance

**BR-CF-011: Financial Reporting Requirements**
- Claims forecasts must be included in monthly financial reporting packages
- Claims variance analysis must be provided with explanatory commentary
- Claims trends must be reported to executive leadership quarterly
- Claims forecasting accuracy must be tracked and reported monthly

**BR-CF-012: Budget Planning Integration**
- Claims forecasts must be incorporated into annual budget planning process
- Claims budgets must be established based on forecasting model outputs
- Budget variance thresholds must be defined for claims categories
- Claims budget adjustments must follow established approval workflows

### 3. System Integration Rules

#### 3.1 Technical Integration Requirements

**Integration Architecture:** API-based integration with insurance claims system  
**Data Security:** Encryption in transit and at rest, role-based access control  
**Performance Standards:** Integration must not impact existing system response times

**Business Rules:**

**BR-CF-013: API Integration Standards**
- Claims system integration must utilize RESTful API architecture
- API calls must include authentication and authorization validation
- Integration must support error handling and retry mechanisms
- API performance must meet existing system response time standards

**BR-CF-014: Data Security Requirements**
- Claims data must be encrypted during transmission and storage
- Access to claims data must be restricted based on user roles and permissions
- Claims data access must be logged and auditable
- Data retention must comply with insurance and regulatory requirements

**BR-CF-015: System Performance Standards**
- Claims data integration must not increase existing system response times by more than 10%
- Claims forecasting calculations must complete within established time limits
- Integration must support concurrent user access without performance degradation
- System availability must maintain existing uptime requirements

#### 3.2 User Interface Integration

**UI Integration:** Claims forecasting integrated into existing forecasting interface  
**User Experience:** Seamless integration with current workflows and navigation  
**Training Requirements:** Minimal additional training for existing users

**Business Rules:**

**BR-CF-016: User Interface Standards**
- Claims forecasting must be accessible through existing forecasting system navigation
- Claims data must be presented in consistent format with other forecasting data
