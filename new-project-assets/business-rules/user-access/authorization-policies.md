# Authorization Policies

## Overview

This document establishes comprehensive authorization policies for managing user permissions and system access across all Towne Park systems. These policies define access control frameworks, permission structures, and authorization procedures to ensure appropriate access to resources and data.

## Core Authorization Principles

### Principle of Least Privilege
- Users granted minimum permissions necessary for job functions
- Regular review and validation of user permissions
- Automatic permission revocation upon role changes
- Time-limited permissions for temporary access needs

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Permissions assigned based on organizational roles
- Standardized role definitions and permission sets
- Hierarchical role structures with inheritance
- Clear separation of duties and responsibilities

### Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)
- Dynamic access decisions based on user, resource, and environmental attributes
- Context-aware access control policies
- Fine-grained permission management
- Policy-driven access control decisions

### Zero Trust Authorization
- Verify every access request regardless of user location or device
- Continuous authorization validation during sessions
- Micro-segmentation of resource access
- Assume breach and limit access scope

## Authorization Framework

## Authorization Rules

### Access Control Rules
- **Rule AUTHZ-001**: All system access requires explicit authorization
- **Rule AUTHZ-002**: Permissions granted based on job role and business need
- **Rule AUTHZ-003**: Temporary permissions require approval and expiration date
- **Rule AUTHZ-004**: Emergency access requires post-access review and justification

### Permission Management Rules
- **Rule AUTHZ-005**: Role changes trigger automatic permission review
- **Rule AUTHZ-006**: Unused permissions automatically revoked after 90 days
- **Rule AUTHZ-007**: Privileged permissions require additional approval
- **Rule AUTHZ-008**: Cross-functional access requires manager approval

### Segregation of Duties Rules
- **Rule AUTHZ-009**: Financial transaction initiation and approval separated
- **Rule AUTHZ-010**: System administration and business operations separated
- **Rule AUTHZ-011**: Data entry and data validation separated
- **Rule AUTHZ-012**: Audit functions independent from operational functions

### Approval Workflow Rules
- **Rule AUTHZ-013**: Manager approval required for direct report access requests
- **Rule AUTHZ-014**: Security team approval required for privileged access
- **Rule AUTHZ-015**: Executive approval required for cross-departmental access

## Access Control Implementation

### Technical Implementation

#### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- **Role Assignment**: Users assigned to roles based on job functions
- **Permission Inheritance**: Roles inherit permissions from parent roles
- **Role Activation**: Users can activate/deactivate roles as needed
- **Role Constraints**: Time and location-based role constraints

- **Adaptive Controls**: Access controls adapt to changing conditions
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Ongoing monitoring of access patterns

### Operational Implementation

#### Access Request Process
1. **Request Submission**: User submits access request with business justification
2. **Manager Review**: Direct manager reviews and approves/denies request
3. **Security Review**: Security team reviews for compliance and risk
4. **Provisioning**: Approved access provisioned automatically
5. **Notification**: User notified of access grant and restrictions

#### Access Review Process
