# Data Quality Standards

## Overview

This document establishes comprehensive data quality standards for all data management activities within the Towne Park system. These standards ensure consistent, accurate, and reliable data across all system components and business processes.

## Core Data Quality Principles

### Accuracy
- Data must correctly represent real-world entities and events
- Regular validation against authoritative sources
- Error detection and correction procedures
- Continuous monitoring of data accuracy metrics

### Completeness
- All required data fields must be populated
- Missing data identification and remediation
- Data completeness monitoring and reporting
- Procedures for handling incomplete data

### Consistency
- Data must be consistent across all systems and databases
- Standardized data formats and representations
- Cross-system data validation and reconciliation
- Consistent business rule application

### Timeliness
- Data must be current and up-to-date
- Timely data updates and synchronization
- Data freshness monitoring and alerting
- Procedures for handling stale or outdated data

### Validity
- Data must conform to defined formats and business rules
- Input validation and constraint enforcement
- Data type and format validation
- Business rule validation and enforcement

### Uniqueness
- Elimination of duplicate data records
- Unique identifier management
- Duplicate detection and resolution procedures
- Data deduplication processes

## Data Quality Framework
