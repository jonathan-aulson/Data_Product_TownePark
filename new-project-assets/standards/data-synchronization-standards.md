# Data Synchronization Standards

## Overview

This document establishes comprehensive data synchronization standards for the Towne Park data platform. These standards ensure consistent, reliable, and efficient data synchronization across all systems, maintaining data integrity and supporting real-time business operations.

## Synchronization Framework

### Core Principles

#### Principle 1: Data Consistency
All synchronized data must maintain consistency across systems with defined consistency models and conflict resolution strategies.

#### Principle 2: Reliability
Data synchronization processes must be reliable with comprehensive error handling, retry mechanisms, and recovery procedures.

#### Principle 3: Performance
Synchronization processes must meet performance requirements without impacting system availability or user experience.

#### Principle 4: Auditability
All synchronization activities must be logged and auditable for compliance and troubleshooting purposes.

#### Principle 5: Scalability
Synchronization architecture must scale to handle increasing data volumes and system complexity.

### Synchronization Types

#### Real-time Synchronization
- **Use Cases**: Critical business data requiring immediate consistency
- **Latency Target**: <5 seconds end-to-end
- **Examples**: Financial transactions, user authentication, critical alerts
- **Technology**: Event-driven architecture with message queues

#### Near Real-time Synchronization
- **Use Cases**: Important business data with moderate latency tolerance
- **Latency Target**: <30 seconds end-to-end
- **Examples**: Customer data updates, inventory changes, status updates
- **Technology**: Change data capture with streaming processing

#### Batch Synchronization
- **Use Cases**: Large data volumes, historical data, reporting data
- **Frequency**: Scheduled intervals (hourly, daily, weekly)
- **Examples**: Analytics data, archived records, bulk imports
- **Technology**: ETL pipelines with data validation

#### On-demand Synchronization
- **Use Cases**: User-initiated data refresh, ad-hoc data requests
- **Trigger**: Manual or API-triggered
- **Examples**: Report generation, data exports, manual refreshes
- **Technology**: API-driven synchronization with queue management

## Synchronization Patterns

### Event-Driven Synchronization

#### Event Sourcing Pattern
