# Data Quality Standards

## Overview

This document establishes comprehensive data quality standards for the Towne Park data platform. These standards ensure data accuracy, consistency, completeness, and reliability across all systems and processes, supporting informed decision-making and regulatory compliance.

## Data Quality Framework

### Core Principles

#### Principle 1: Accuracy
Data must correctly represent the real-world entities, events, and relationships it describes.

#### Principle 2: Completeness
All required data elements must be present and populated according to business requirements.

#### Principle 3: Consistency
Data must be uniform in format, structure, and meaning across all systems and time periods.

#### Principle 4: Timeliness
Data must be available when needed and reflect the most current state of business operations.

#### Principle 5: Validity
Data must conform to defined formats, ranges, and business rules.

#### Principle 6: Uniqueness
Duplicate records must be identified, managed, and resolved according to established procedures.

### Data Quality Dimensions

#### Accuracy Standards
- **Financial Data**: 99.95% accuracy requirement with zero tolerance for calculation errors
- **Customer Data**: 99.9% accuracy with quarterly validation against source systems
- **Operational Data**: 99.5% accuracy with daily validation processes
- **Reference Data**: 100% accuracy requirement with immediate correction of errors

#### Completeness Standards
- **Critical Fields**: 100% completion rate for all mandatory business fields
- **Optional Fields**: Minimum 80% completion rate for enhanced analytics
- **Historical Data**: Complete data sets for minimum 7-year retention period
- **Real-time Data**: 99.9% availability during business hours

#### Consistency Standards
- **Data Formats**: Standardized formats across all systems and interfaces
- **Naming Conventions**: Consistent entity and attribute naming across platforms
- **Code Values**: Standardized reference data and lookup values
- **Business Rules**: Uniform application of business logic across all systems
