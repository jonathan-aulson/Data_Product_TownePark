# System Resilience Guidelines

## Overview

This document establishes comprehensive system resilience guidelines for the Towne Park data platform. These guidelines ensure high availability, fault tolerance, and rapid recovery capabilities across all systems and services, supporting business continuity and operational excellence.

## Resilience Framework

### Core Principles

#### Principle 1: Design for Failure
All systems must be designed with the assumption that components will fail, and must continue operating with degraded functionality.

#### Principle 2: Redundancy and Failover
Critical systems must have redundant components and automatic failover capabilities to eliminate single points of failure.

#### Principle 3: Graceful Degradation
Systems should degrade gracefully under stress, maintaining core functionality while shedding non-essential features.

#### Principle 4: Rapid Recovery
Systems must be designed for rapid detection, isolation, and recovery from failures with minimal business impact.

#### Principle 5: Continuous Monitoring
Comprehensive monitoring and alerting must provide early warning of potential issues and system degradation.

### Resilience Levels

#### Level 1: Basic Resilience

- **Recovery Time**: 4 hours maximum
- **Data Loss**: 1 hour maximum
