# FIBO Financial Ontology Integration Specification

## 🎯 Executive Summary

**COMPREHENSIVE FIBO INTEGRATION**: This specification defines the complete integration of the Financial Industry Business Ontology (FIBO) with Towne Park's financial systems, including domain-specific extensions, autonomous classification capabilities, and continuous learning frameworks.

**CRITICAL INTEGRATION**: This specification implements FIBO-based financial ontology integration with Towne Park domain-specific extensions, autonomous classification capabilities, and comprehensive regulatory compliance validation.

**Problem Solved**: Provides systematic financial ontology integration that enables accurate classification of financial entities, automated business rule extraction, and comprehensive regulatory compliance validation across all Towne Park financial systems.

## 🏗️ FIBO INTEGRATION OVERVIEW

The FIBO Financial Ontology Integration Specification enables autonomous financial context discovery with domain-specific extensions, ensuring accurate classification and comprehensive business rule extraction for all Towne Park financial systems.
