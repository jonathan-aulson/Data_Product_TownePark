**Annual M&A Integration Savings**: Approximately **$28,600 - $42,900**

extrapolated: true

basis: "Based on 2-3 acquisitions per year with average of 15 sites each"

confidence: "medium-low"

**Justification**: Based on 2-3 acquisitions yearly with 15 sites each (30-45 sites total), calculating time savings for both standard sites (85% time reduction) and complex sites (87.5% reduction). Additional integration efficiencies include data mapping, system configuration, testing, and training (estimated 75% reduction in effort). Using a $40/hour blended rate, this yields approximately $28,600 for 2 acquisitions and $42,900 for 3 acquisitions annually.

**4.2 Billing Cycle Improvements**

1.  Maintained 7-day billing cycle for all 741 customers despite absorbing 2 new acquisition companies

**4.**       **Total Estimated Annual ROI**

| Category | Annual Value | Per Customer Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Direct Labor Savings | $499,500 | $674 |
| Process Efficiency Savings | $855,543 | $1,155 |
| Revenue Recovery | $516,000 - $1,032,000 | $696 - $1,393 |
| Cashflow Improvement Value | $1,300,000 | $1,754 |

| Total Estimated Annual Value | $3,199,643 - $3,729,943 | $4,318 - $5,034 |

extrapolated: true

basis: "Combination of direct client data and extrapolated figures, including 741 total customers"

confidence: "medium-high"

**Justification**: Direct Labor Savings from section 1.2 ($499,500). Process Efficiency Savings combines Customer Setup ($148,200), Future Migration ($294,000), and Online Customer processing ($413,343) for a total of $855,543. Revenue Recovery and Cashflow values from sections 3.2 and 3.3. M&A Integration Savings from section 4.1. Per customer values calculated by dividing each amount by 741 total customers.

**5.1 ROI Metrics**

**Estimated Implementation Cost Range**: $1.5M - $2.5M

**Estimated Per Customer Implementation Cost**: $2,025 - $3,374

**Estimated Payback Period**: 4-7 months

**3-Year ROI**: **284% - 646%**

**5-Year ROI**: **540% - 1,143%**

extrapolated: true

basis: "Industry standard implementation costs for enterprise billing systems of similar complexity"

confidence: "medium-low"

**Justification**: 3-Year ROI calculated as (3-year benefits minus implementation cost) divided by implementation cost. Using the annual value range of $3.2M-$3.73M and implementation cost range of $1.5M-$2.5M:

·        Lower bound: (3 × $3.2M - $2.5M) / $2.5M × 100% = 284%

·        Upper bound: (3 × $3.73M - $1.5M) / $1.5M × 100% = 646%

Similarly, 5-Year ROI:

*   Lower bound: (5 × $3.2M - $2.5M) / $2.5M × 100% = 540%
*   Upper bound: (5 × $3.73M - $1.5M) / $1.5M × 100% = 1,143%
