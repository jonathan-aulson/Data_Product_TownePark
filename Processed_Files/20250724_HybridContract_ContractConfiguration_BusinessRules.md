# Towne Park Hybrid Contract Configuration - Business Rules

## Overview

Hybrid contracts represent the most complex billing arrangements in Towne Park's contract portfolio, combining multiple billing models within a single contract to accommodate diverse customer requirements. These contracts demonstrate the flexibility of the PowerBill system to handle sophisticated billing scenarios that require multiple revenue streams, different calculation methods, and advanced features like invoice grouping and mid-month advances.

**Business Context**: Hybrid contracts are typically used for large, complex customer sites that require multiple service types with different billing models. They allow Towne Park to provide comprehensive service packages while maintaining clear billing separation and accurate revenue attribution.

## Hybrid Contract Types and Patterns

### **Pattern 1: Fixed Fee + Per Labor Hour Combination**
**Most Common Hybrid Pattern** - Used for sites requiring both guaranteed service levels and variable labor components.

#### **Business Rule: FF-PLH-001 - Fixed Fee Base Service with Variable Labor**
- **Description**: Combines guaranteed monthly service fees with hourly billing for additional or specialized labor
- **Applies To**: Medical centers, hospitals, and facilities requiring both base service guarantees and flexible staffing
- **Calculation Formula**: 
  ```
  Monthly Invoice Total = Fixed Fee Amount + (Labor Hours × Hourly Rate)
  ```
- **Implementation**: Both components bill to same invoice group unless otherwise specified
- **Edge Cases**: 
  - Fixed fee components may have different escalation schedules than labor hour components
  - Labor hour components may include overtime calculations
  - Some sites bill fixed insurance separately from variable labor costs

#### **Representative Examples**:

**Site 0338 - Baltimore Washington Medical Center**:
- **Fixed Fee Component**: Account Manager Fee = $7,096.27 (Code 4715)
- **Per Labor Hour Components**:
  - GSA: $25.03 regular / $37.55 overtime
  - GSC: $25.03 regular / $37.55 overtime  
  - Additional GSA (GARAGE): $25.03 regular / $37.55 overtime
- **Escalation**: 3% annual increase in July
- **Payment Terms**: 45 days

**Site 0487 - OSF Saint Francis Medical Center**:
- **Fixed Fee Component**: Shuttle Insurance = $3,125.00 (Code 4705)
- **Per Labor Hour Components**:
  - Manager (ACCTMGR): $23.21
  - Assistant Manager (ASSOCM): $21.99
  - GSA: $20.54
  - GSC: $21.99
  - Inside Shuttle Driver (SHUTL1): $20.54
  - Outside Shuttle Driver (SHUTL2): $21.99
  - Traffic Controller (TRAFFIC): $20.54
- **Escalation**: 3% annual increase in January
- **Special Notes**: Shuttle billing changed to ledger-based vs. AM reports per Finance confirmation

**Site 0534 - Nebraska Methodist Hospital**:
- **Fixed Fee Component**: Valet Services = $38,642.00 (Code 4700)
- **Per Labor Hour Component**: Additional Services (GSA3) = $19.95
- **Escalation**: No automatic escalation configured
- **Payment Terms**: 30 days

### **Pattern 2: Revenue Share + Per Labor Hour with Advanced Features**
**Complex Multi-Component Pattern** - Used for high-volume sites requiring both revenue participation and specialized labor billing.

#### **Business Rule: RS-PLH-001 - Revenue Share with Separated Labor Billing**
- **Description**: Revenue share for parking operations with separate per labor hour billing for specialized services
- **Applies To**: Large hotels and resorts with significant parking revenue and specialized service requirements
- **Calculation Formula**:
  ```
  Revenue Share Amount = (Qualifying Revenue × Share Percentage) - Validation Threshold
  Labor Hour Amount = Σ(Job Hours × Job Rate) by Job Code
  Total Invoice = Revenue Share Amount + Labor Hour Amount + Mid Month Advance + Other Components
  ```
- **Implementation**: Requires invoice grouping to separate revenue share from labor hour billing
- **Edge Cases**:
  - Mid-month advances affect cash flow timing
  - Deposited revenue handling requires special tax considerations
  - Different escalation schedules for labor rates vs. revenue share percentages

#### **Representative Example**:

**Site 0429 - Anaheim Marriott**:
- **Revenue Share Component**:
  - Share Percentage: 24% (flat rate)
  - Accumulation Type: Monthly
  - Validation Threshold: 3% of revenue
  - Revenue Codes: All standard parking codes (ADJ, OR1-3, SD1-3, SM1-3, SO1-3, VD1-3, VM1-3, VO1-3)
  - Invoice Group: 1 ("Rev Share")
- **Per Labor Hour Components**:
  - Bell (BELL): $24.84 regular and overtime
  - Room Steward (ROOMSTEW): $26.00 regular / $32.50 overtime
  - Invoice Group: 2 ("PLH")
- **Advanced Features**:
  - Mid Month Advance: $30,000 (Invoice Group 1)
  - Deposited Revenue: Enabled (Invoice Group 1)
  - Invoice Grouping: Separate invoices for Rev Share vs. PLH
- **Escalation**: Bell PLH rate increases 2.5% annually on January 1st
- **Special Notes**: 2025 rate catch-up implemented - Bell rate increased to $24.84

### **Pattern 3: Fixed Fee + Revenue Share + Billable Accounts**
**Comprehensive Service Pattern** - Used for sites requiring guaranteed services, revenue participation, and expense reimbursement.

#### **Business Rule: FF-RS-BA-001 - Multi-Component Service Agreement**
- **Description**: Combines fixed service fees, revenue sharing, and billable expense accounts for comprehensive service agreements
- **Applies To**: Premium hotel properties requiring full-service management with revenue participation
- **Calculation Formula**:
  ```
  Fixed Fee Amount = Service Rate (subject to escalation)
  Revenue Share Amount = (Qualifying Revenue × Share Percentage) above Threshold
  Billable Accounts = Σ(Enabled Expense Accounts) + PTEB Calculations
  Total Invoice = Fixed Fee Amount + Revenue Share Amount + Billable Accounts
  ```
- **Implementation**: All components typically bill to same invoice group unless separated
- **Edge Cases**:
  - Revenue share thresholds may have multiple tiers
  - Billable accounts may include both payroll and expense components
  - Different validation thresholds for revenue vs. expense components

#### **Representative Example**:

**Site 0293 - Hilton Dallas Lincoln Center**:
- **Fixed Fee Component**: Shuttle Services = $1,000.00 (Code 4705)
- **Revenue Share Component**:
  - Tier 1: 32.5% on revenue above $750,000 annually
  - Tier 2: 25% on revenue up to $750,000 annually
  - Accumulation Type: Annual Calendar
  - Validation Threshold: 5% of revenue
  - Revenue Codes: All standard parking codes
- **Billable Accounts Component**:
  - Payroll Accounts: Site Salaries & Wages (all disabled in this example)
  - PTEB: Disabled
  - Support Services: Disabled
  - Expense Accounts: Vehicle-related expenses enabled
    - Equipment Lease - Vehicles (7060): Enabled
    - Equipment Rental - Vehicles (7070): Enabled
    - Fuel - Vehicles (7075): Enabled
    - Insurance - Vehicle (7082): Enabled
    - Repairs & Maintenance - Vehicle (7178): Enabled
    - Vehicle Expense (7230): Enabled
- **Escalation**: No automatic escalation configured
- **Payment Terms**: 30 days

## Advanced Hybrid Contract Features

### **Invoice Grouping for Hybrid Contracts**

#### **Business Rule: IG-001 - Separate Invoice Generation**
- **Description**: Creates separate invoices for different billing components within the same contract
- **Applies To**: Contracts requiring separate billing streams for accounting or customer preference
- **Implementation**:
  - Each invoice group generates a separate invoice document
  - Components are assigned to specific invoice groups during configuration
  - Invoice group titles provide clear identification (e.g., "Rev Share", "PLH")
- **Benefits**:
  - Clearer financial reporting and reconciliation
  - Separate payment tracking for different service types
  - Enhanced customer understanding of billing components

**Example Implementation (Site 0429)**:
- **Invoice Group 1**: "Rev Share" - Contains revenue share, mid-month advance, deposited revenue
- **Invoice Group 2**: "PLH" - Contains all per labor hour charges

### **Mid-Month Advance Integration**

#### **Business Rule: MMA-001 - Cash Flow Management**
- **Description**: Provides mid-month cash advances against expected monthly revenue share
- **Applies To**: High-volume revenue share contracts requiring improved cash flow
- **Calculation Formula**:
  ```
  Mid-Month Advance = Fixed Amount (typically 40-60% of expected monthly revenue share)
  Month-End Reconciliation = Actual Revenue Share - Mid-Month Advance
  ```
- **Implementation**: Mid-month advance appears as separate line item, reconciled at month-end
- **Edge Cases**: Negative reconciliation results in customer credit or reduced next advance

### **Deposited Revenue Handling**

#### **Business Rule: DR-001 - Tax and Revenue Management**
- **Description**: Manages revenue deposited directly by customer vs. collected by Towne Park
- **Applies To**: Contracts where customer collects and deposits parking revenue directly
- **Implementation**:
  - Deposited revenue flag indicates customer responsibility for parking tax
  - Revenue share calculations based on deposited amounts
  - Special reporting requirements for tax compliance
- **Tax Implications**: Customer responsible for parking tax when deposited revenue is enabled

## Escalation Rules for Hybrid Contracts

### **Component-Specific Escalation**

#### **Business Rule: ESC-HYB-001 - Independent Component Escalation**

- **Description**: Manages escalation timing across multiple contract components
- **Applies To**: Hybrid contracts with multiple escalation schedules
- **Implementation**:
  - Contract-level escalation month applies to most components
  - Individual components may override with specific escalation timing
  - Special handling for catch-up escalations when rates fall behind schedule

## Payment Terms and Billing Coordination

### **Unified Payment Terms**

#### **Business Rule: PAY-HYB-001 - Contract-Level Payment Terms**
- **Description**: All components within a hybrid contract follow the same payment terms
- **Applies To**: All hybrid contracts regardless of component complexity
- **Implementation**: Payment terms set at contract level apply to all invoice groups
- **Standard Terms**:
  - 30 days: Most common (Sites 0429, 0487, 0534)
  - 45 days: Extended terms for specific customers (Site 0338)

### **Purchase Order Management**

#### **Business Rule: PO-HYB-001 - Component Purchase Order Assignment**
- **Description**: Purchase orders may apply to entire contract or specific components
- **Applies To**: Contracts requiring purchase order references
- **Implementation**:
  - Contract-level PO applies to all components unless overridden
