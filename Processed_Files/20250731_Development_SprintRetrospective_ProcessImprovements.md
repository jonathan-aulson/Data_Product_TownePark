# Towne Park Development - Sprint Retrospective Process Improvements

## Meeting Overview

**Date**: July 31, 2025  
**Duration**: 30 minutes 3 seconds  
**Meeting Type**: Sprint Retrospective  
**Participants**: Christopher Thompson, Javier Casas, Cesar Figueroa, Jonathan Aulson, Graham Olson

## Key Process Improvements Identified

### Demo Process Enhancement

#### Current Issues Identified
- **Developer Bias Problem**: Person who implemented the feature also presented the demo, leading to biased testing and missed issues
- **Acceptance Criteria Gaps**: Features were being released to develop without fully meeting acceptance criteria
- **Testing Blind Spots**: Developers testing their own work created confirmation bias

#### Proposed Solutions

**1. Story Ownership Separation**
- **Implementation**: Separate the person who does the work from the person who owns the story
- **Demo Responsibility**: Story owner conducts the demo, not the developer who implemented it
- **Benefit**: Provides outside perspective without preconceived notions about implementation

**2. Demo Preparation Protocol**
- **Agenda Creation**: Story owner creates demo agenda based on acceptance criteria
- **AI Assistance**: Leverage AI to generate demo flows that exercise all acceptance criteria efficiently
- **Timing**: 5-minute preparation before demo to review agenda and acceptance criteria

**3. Demo Timing in Workflow**
- **Preferred Approach**: Demo from feature branch before merging to develop
- **Fallback Protocol**: If issues arise where feature branch demo doesn't match develop behavior, demo from develop
- **Issue Resolution**: If demo reveals issues, move story back to active status and create bug fix tasks

#### Demo Section Addition to User Stories
- **Implementation**: Add demo section to user stories during creation
- **Content**: Ordered set of steps that exercise all acceptance criteria efficiently
- **Example**: 10-step demo flow might exercise 25 different acceptance criteria when done in optimal order

### AI Integration Challenges

#### Identified Issues
- **Confirmation Bias**: AI tends to want to be correct and complete, potentially overlooking issues
- **Speed vs Quality**: Moving faster with AI increases risk of overlooking details
- **Complexity Factor**: Higher complexity features combined with AI usage increases error potential

#### Proposed Mitigation Strategies

**1. Validation Prompts**
- **Implementation**: Add prompts asking AI to explain how changes impact acceptance criteria
- **Requirement**: Force AI to validate acceptance criteria achievement before completion

**2. Test Case Generation**
- **Approach**: Have AI generate comprehensive test cases for complex features
- **Validation**: Use test cases to validate inputs, outputs, and edge cases
- **Coverage**: Ensure all scenarios and configurations are tested

**3. Automated Testing Integration**
- **Current State**: AI is automatically creating tests in console for functions
- **Enhancement**: Gather more information about automated test generation capabilities
- **Implementation**: Integrate automated testing into development workflow

### Project Complexity Analysis

#### Contributing Factors to Recent Issues
1. **Increased Complexity**: Features are more complex than initial billing system work
2. **Integration Challenges**: More entry points and system interactions
3. **End-Game Pressure**: Final project phases require tying all components together
4. **AI Dependency**: Increased reliance on AI tools in development process
5. **Component Overlap**: Multiple stories affecting same components within sprints

#### Historical Context
- **Billing System Era**: Simpler UI with backend calculations in Power Automate
- **Current Forecasting**: Complex UI components with real-time calculations
- **Evolution**: From "first draft" tolerance to production-ready requirements

## Future Project Roadmap

### Immediate Next Steps
- **Decision Point**: Grow another team vs. grow current team
- **Timeline**: Projects stacked through end of 2027
- **Capacity Planning**: Need to determine optimal team structure

### Upcoming Projects (Priority Order)

**1. Billing Phase 3**
- **Scope**: Build Power Bill features for 10-percenters
- **Timeline**: Likely concurrent with RSS development
- **Impact**: Enable all 10-percenters to bill through Power Bill RSS

**2. RSS Front-end Development**
- **Current State**: RSS file ingestion mechanism exists
- **Enhancement**: Build front-end for online revenue and stats entry
- **Benefit**: Replace manual file submission with web interface

**3. Budgeting System**
- **Timeline**: Early summer start for Q4 completion
- **Integration**: Work with forecasting and billing systems
- **Goal**: Complete budgeting/forecasting/billing ecosystem by 2027 budget cycle

**4. AI Enterprise Implementation**
- **Scope**: Implement Towne Park enterprise AI bot
- **Status**: Currently in sales process
- **Potential**: Significant enterprise-wide impact

### Strategic Positioning
- **Trusted Advisor Status**: Team has become go-to resource for finance department
- **IT Bypass**: Finance department prefers team over internal IT for projects
- **Growth Opportunity**: Strong client relationship enables continued expansion

## Action Items

### Immediate Implementation
1. **Update User Story Template**: Add demo section to all new user stories
2. **Assign Story Owners**: Ensure story owners are different from primary developers
3. **Demo Scheduling**: Implement demo-before-merge workflow
4. **AI Prompt Enhancement**: Add validation requirements to AI development prompts

### Process Validation
1. **Monitor Demo Effectiveness**: Track issue discovery rate in demos vs. post-merge
2. **AI Integration Assessment**: Evaluate impact of AI validation prompts
3. **Complexity Management**: Develop strategies for handling multi-component stories

### Team Development
1. **Cross-Training**: Ensure team members can demo features they didn't develop
2. **AI Tool Optimization**: Investigate automated testing capabilities
3. **Process Documentation**: Document new demo and validation procedures
