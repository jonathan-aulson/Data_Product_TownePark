## 1. Revenue Management

### 1.1. Revenue Share Functionality

#### 1.1.1. Revenue Code Visibility Issue

**Source Document(s):** `20250612_DailyScrum`
**Date Discussed/Decided:** `2025-06-12`
**Key Stakeholders Involved:** `Jonathan Aulson (Business Analyst)`, `Gayasuddin Gayasi (Tester)`
**Version/Status:** `v1.0 - Open Issue`
**Tags:** `#issue` `#testing` `#UI` `#revenue` `#billing`
**Integration Points:** `API`
**Decision Log References:** `I003`

Jonathan Aulson discussed an issue raised by Gayasuddin Gayasi regarding revenue share testing:

"First one guyas brought up an issue with testing revenue share and the issue is that when you set multiple threshold structures on a revenue share. You're assigning... seeing the revenue by Revenue Code and that Revenue Code isn't visible anywhere on the invoice. So it's hard to know how to. It's hard to validate that through the UI."

The issue affects the ability to verify that revenue calculations are correctly assigned to the proper revenue codes during revenue share testing, as these codes are not visible in the invoice UI.

**Proposed Solutions:**
1. "We could use an API call to surface that Revenue Code in the front end on the statement so that they can validate that the money was was associated with the correct line item."
2. "We could generate past invoices. And as long as those past invoices always generated the same, I think that means the logic in the flow was all working the same right? If we generate the same month invoice over and over. It should capture the same revenue codes over and over again."
3. "We could see the database with the TP stage database with... with data."

**Open Questions:**
- Which approach provides the best balance of test validation without excessive development work?
- Should the Revenue Code be permanently added to the UI for better transparency?

### 1.2. Invoice Generation

#### 1.2.1. Divide by Zero Error Fix

**Source Document(s):** `20250617_DailyScrum`
**Date Discussed/Decided:** `2025-06-17`
**Key Stakeholders Involved:** `Shravan Modi (Developer)`, `Pratik Bedekar`
**Version/Status:** `v1.0 - Resolved`
**Tags:** `#issue` `#technical` `#error` `#billing` `#invoicing`
**Decision Log References:** `I005`

Shravan Modi identified and resolved an issue with invoice generation:

"So we found the divide by zero error for the revenue amount. So and we, we found that the flow was triggered. Before the four minutes before updating the value in the database. So from the database the value was not value is not coming at that moment and the value was coming at at that moment 0. So it was failed at that moment and but later on today when we tried to reproduce on the, it did not reproduce."

The issue occurred because a flow was triggered before the necessary data was updated in the database, resulting in a divide by zero error. The timing issue appears to be intermittent.

**Resolution Details:**
- Root cause: Flow triggering before database values were updated
- The zero value caused a division error in revenue amount calculation
- Reproduction was inconsistent, suggesting a race condition
- Recommended action: Ask users to retry statement generation for the affected site

**Related Information:**
- Pratik Bedekar noted this was related to a support ticket that Amy had raised

#### 1.2.2. Trailing Zeros Display Issue

**Source Document(s):** `20250618_DailyScrum`
**Date Discussed/Decided:** `2025-06-18`
**Key Stakeholders Involved:** `Shravan Modi (Developer)`
**Version/Status:** `v1.0 - Resolved`
**Tags:** `#issue` `#UI` `#display` `#billing` `#invoicing`
**Decision Log References:** `I006`

Shravan Modi reported fixing an issue with displaying trailing zeros in invoice descriptions:

"I worked on one of the issue for the power description in the invoice in the description for the regular hours and the over time hours we are there was a issue of sowing the trailing zeros after decimals up to four digits. So it was showing 0 even though there are there were no valid values greater than 0. So we fix those issue in the power automate flow in the power in the management fee."

The issue involved unnecessary trailing zeros being displayed in the description fields for regular and overtime hours on invoices, even when the values were not meaningful.

**Technical Implementation Details:**
- Bug number: 2344
- Fix implemented in Power Automate flow
- Specifically addressed in the management fee section

## 2. Data Processing and Storage

### 2.1. Error Handling

#### 2.1.1. Invalid Date Handling in Input Files

**Source Document(s):** `20250618_DailyScrum`
**Date Discussed/Decided:** `2025-06-18`
**Key Stakeholders Involved:** `Shravan Modi (Developer)`, `Pratik Bedekar`, `Cesar Figueroa`, `Jonathan Aulson (Business Analyst)`
**Version/Status:** `v1.0 - Resolved`
**Tags:** `#issue` `#technical` `#data` `#integration` `#error`
**Integration Points:** `SharePoint` `Logic App` `ETW Database`
**Decision Log References:** `I004`

A detailed discussion about handling invalid dates in input files:

Pratik Bedekar explained: "When we submit a shade that is A1 tab call daily, uh daily something and in that tab we have a particular site and the data for all the dates like one at first June, 1st April and 2nd April 3rd April and then what happened that they are creating the date still 30 April but they add a blank row with 31st April as well, which is actually not valid date."

The issue occurs when spreadsheets include invalid dates (like April 31st) or empty date fields. The system was inserting default dates (December 30, 1899) for these records but not properly purging them when new data was uploaded.

**Technical Implementation Details:**
- When blank date fields are encountered, the system assigns December 30, 1899 as a default date
- The data deletion logic was not properly handling these default-dated records
- The team implemented a fix to ignore these invalid date lines in the Logic App

Cesar Figueroa's recommendation: "So basically we update the logic app to ignore deadline because it's an invalid line and you will need to to submit a request to delete the other one and will not have impact because we are sure that this is the reason and it's not."

**Resolution Actions:**
1. Update Logic App to ignore rows with invalid dates
2. Submit a request to delete existing invalid records from the database

### 2.2. Monitoring and Alerting Implementation

#### 2.2.1. System Monitoring Approach

**Source Document(s):** `20250613_DailyScrum`, `20250616_DailyScrum`
**Date Discussed/Decided:** `2025-06-13` to `2025-06-16`
**Key Stakeholders Involved:** `Cesar Figueroa (Lead)`, `Pratik Bedekar`, `Shravan Modi`
**Version/Status:** `v1.0 - In Progress`
**Tags:** `#technical` `#monitoring` `#infrastructure` `#planning`
**Decision Log References:** `D003`

Cesar Figueroa outlined a phased approach to implementing monitoring:

"We we selected just a couple of metrics. So in my opinion the first things that we need to do is exploring. One the requirements that we need to install that solution. What kind of privileges? What kind of connections we need to set? Basically, attract that down in a document. Second, try to implement just and small and cup of metrics. Not everything, because that can be hard."

The team decided to start with a small proof of concept for monitoring rather than attempting to implement all possible metrics at once.

**Implementation Phases:**
1. Document requirements including privileges and connections needed
2. Implement a small set of core metrics as a proof of concept
3. Design a plan for potentially implementing additional metrics

**Technical Context:**
- Solution appears to be a Microsoft-provided monitoring package
- Implementation requires careful planning and privilege configuration
- Implementation complexity is significant enough that companies typically charge for this service

Pratik Bedekar confirmed on June 16th: "From my side, mostly I was looking into the dataverse notification and alerts that we discussed on Friday and for that the approach that we decided on Friday, I was doing RND for that and I was reviewing."

**Open Questions:**
- Which specific metrics should be included in the initial implementation?
- What are the full privilege requirements?
- Timeline for completing the proof of concept?

## 3. System Administration

### 3.1. Database Maintenance

#### 3.1.1. Database Alerts Implementation

**Source Document(s):** `20250617_DailyScrum`
**Date Discussed/Decided:** `2025-06-17`
**Key Stakeholders Involved:** `Shravan Modi (Developer)`, `Cesar Figueroa`
**Version/Status:** `v1.0 - In Progress`
**Tags:** `#technical` `#database` `#monitoring` `#alerts`
**Integration Points:** `Dataverse`

Shravan Modi reported on implementing database alerts:

"And then I continue on the alerts alerts part for the database I go. I've gone through that loop, documented seizure, Cesar, prepared for the Coe power platform and we we started implementing in our isolated environment. But at that moment we faced some of the privileges that we cannot import that solution because that was a managed solution."

The team is working on implementing database alerts using a solution prepared by Cesar Figueroa for the Power Platform Center of Excellence (CoE).

**Technical Implementation Details:**
- Implementation is happening in an isolated environment
- Team encountered privilege issues with importing the managed solution
- Cesar provided access to resolve the privilege issue
- Team is now reviewing the flows to understand the functionality

**Next Steps:**
- Complete review of the alert flows
- Finalize implementation in the isolated environment
- Determine deployment approach to production
