## 1. Development Infrastructure and Environment

### 1.1. Database Migration and Node Management

#### 1.1.1. Node Migration Strategy

**Source Document(s):** `20250606_DailyScrum`
**Date Discussed/Decided:** `2025-06-06`
**Key Stakeholders Involved:** `Cesar Figueroa (Lead)`
**Version/Status:** `v1.0 - In Progress`
**Tags:** `#technical` `#database` `#integration` `#migration`
**Integration Points:** `Node1` `Node2` `PP EDW Dev`

Cesar Figueroa reported on the migration approach between nodes:

"I emigrated training step because it's very environment that no one is using, but I had some problems with some privileges. I had a discussion today with one who helps me to solve that. Then he raised that they already have the... You know, for development, so I will be evaluating how we can planning demuration from node one in development to a developed UAT training to to know to that know that new node that is not note two or not one is this other node."

The team is working on migrating from Node 1 to a new development node (not Node 2), with Cesar focusing on solving privilege issues in the training environment.

**Technical Implementation Details:**
- Testing and training environments needed migration first
- Privileges issues were encountered requiring resolution
- Node 1 to new development node (not Node 2) migration planning is underway

**Open Questions:**
- Complete privilege requirements for migration
- Timeline for completing the migration to the new node

### 1.2. Deployment Process Improvements

#### 1.2.1. Pull Request Documentation Standards

**Source Document(s):** `20250602_DailyScrum`
**Date Discussed/Decided:** `2025-06-02`
**Key Stakeholders Involved:** `Cesar Figueroa (Lead)`, `Christopher Thompson`
**Version/Status:** `v1.0 - Approved`
**Tags:** `#decision` `#technical` `#deployment` `#process`

Cesar Figueroa introduced a streamlined approach for documenting changes in pull requests:

"What we discussed with Christopher on Friday is we only need to see the delta. And the delta is just what requires all attention. For example, if you change and store procedure, please add... a tag explaining that you updated a stored procedure and then in the discussion for example the script."

The team decided to focus on documenting only the changes that require special attention during deployment rather than extensive documentation of all changes.

**Key Decisions:**
- Add specific tags in pull requests to identify changes requiring deployment attention
- Include scripts for stored procedure changes in the discussion
- Create query-based reports to track deployment requirements
- Apply similar tagging for PDF container changes and other deployment-sensitive modifications

**Implementation Process:**
- Developers add appropriate tags when submitting pull requests
- Tags identify the type of change (stored procedure, PDF container, API, etc.)
- Deployment managers can create queries to find all changes of a particular type

## 2. Data Integration and Processing

### 2.1. Job Code Rate Data Flow

#### 2.1.1. Average Hourly Rate Implementation

**Source Document(s):** `20250609_DailyScrum`
**Date Discussed/Decided:** `2025-06-09`
**Key Stakeholders Involved:** `Christopher Thompson (Lead)`
**Version/Status:** `v1.0 - In Progress`
**Tags:** `#technical` `#data` `#integration` `#dataflow`
**Integration Points:** `EDW` `GP Table` `Node1`

Christopher Thompson reported progress on implementing data flows for job code rates:

"Spent a good chunk of the day looking at our data flow to populate the job codes by site rates. Made some good progress with the average hourly rate. Got that one done. Spent some time confirming that we have the GP table in node one that we need for our later story to validate our unit accounts batch."

This implementation is addressing the population of job codes by site rates, with the average hourly rate calculation successfully implemented.

**Technical Implementation Details:**
- Average hourly rate calculation has been completed
- GP table in Node 1 has been confirmed as available for later validation work
- Work continues on other aspects of the job code rate data flow

#### 2.1.2. Service Principal Authorization Issues

**Source Document(s):** `20250609_DailyScrum`
**Date Discussed/Decided:** `2025-06-09`
**Key Stakeholders Involved:** `Christopher Thompson (Lead)`, `Cesar Figueroa`
**Version/Status:** `v1.0 - Blocked`
**Tags:** `#issue` `#technical` `#security` `#integration` `#dataflow`
**Integration Points:** `EDW` `Stored Procedures`

An issue was identified with using service principal accounts for data flow error handling:

"Spent some time working with Cesar on the flow we use for error handling for our dataflow trying to see if we could get that working with the service principal account, so it's not using my credentials. Unfortunately, didn't make too much headway. Tried a bunch of permissions but none of them seem to give the stored procedure for the service principal, the credentials we needed."

The team attempted to switch from using Christopher's personal credentials to a service principal account for data flow error handling, but encountered permission issues.

**Key Issues:**
- Service principal lacks required permissions to execute stored procedures
- Multiple permission configurations were attempted without success
- Currently using Christopher's account as a workaround

**Open Questions:**
- What specific permissions are needed for the service principal?
- Is there a security constraint preventing this access?

### 2.2. Logic App Data Processing

#### 2.2.1. RSS File Processing Strategy

**Source Document(s):** `20250610_DailyScrum`
**Date Discussed/Decided:** `2025-06-10`
**Key Stakeholders Involved:** `Jonathan Aulson (Lead)`, `Christopher Thompson`
**Version/Status:** `v1.0 - Clarification Needed`
**Tags:** `#issue` `#technical` `#integration` `#data`
**Integration Points:** `RSS Files` `EDW`

A discussion about RSS file processing strategy took place:

"So he's implying that we should only use the most recent file... Yeah, I think it's the RSS file. But is that? That changes daily, or it's potentially changing daily so. Yeah, let me. I'll keep asking them questions here until I understand exactly what he's saying."

The team is seeking clarification on which RSS file versions to use in their processing logic, with Jonathan following up to get more details.

**Open Questions:**
- Should only the most recent RSS file be processed?
- How to handle files that change daily?
- What is the specific implementation requirement from Jim?

## 3. Application Features and UI

### 3.1. Save Functionality Improvements

#### 3.1.1. Tab-Specific Save Implementation

**Source Document(s):** `20250603_DailyScrum`
**Date Discussed/Decided:** `2025-06-03`
**Key Stakeholders Involved:** `Jonathan Aulson (Lead)`
**Version/Status:** `v1.0 - Proposed`
**Tags:** `#requirement` `#UI` `#UX` `#technical`

Jonathan outlined a proposed improvement to the save functionality:

"We talked about changes to save functionality. So the idea is to do saves for only tabs that have been modified. And then the toaster message will say something like successful save of XYZ tabs... Like whatever had been modified, right? And I think that... And then you know clears clears are, is dirty or whatever. I guess the tab dirty state. So that's the idea."

This enhancement would make the save functionality more intuitive by only saving modified tabs and providing clear feedback to users.

**Technical Implementation Details:**
- Save operation to target only modified tabs
- Toaster message to display which tabs were saved
- Reset "dirty" state on tabs after successful save

**Related Components:**
- Tab interface components
- Save functionality
- User notification system

#### 3.1.2. Environment Tag for Revenue Reports

**Source Document(s):** `20250603_DailyScrum`
**Date Discussed/Decided:** `2025-06-03`
**Key Stakeholders Involved:** `Christopher Thompson (Lead)`, `Jonathan Aulson`
**Version/Status:** `v1.0 - Proposed`
**Tags:** `#requirement` `#technical` `#reporting`

Christopher Thompson suggested implementing environment tags for revenue report emails:

"I think there's also that 11731 which is adding the environment tag kind of to the revenue report emails, right. And that one's like a super low hanging fruit. We could probably do that real quick and clear that off."

This is described as a simple enhancement that would add environment information to revenue report emails.

**Key Implementation Points:**
- Add environment tag to revenue report emails
- Described as "low hanging fruit" that could be implemented quickly
