## Executive Summary

This document captures a proof of concept exploration using Claude AI to analyze and optimize Power Automate flows for Towne Park's billing system. The POC revealed that while AI can effectively identify performance bottlenecks and suggest optimizations (such as adding filters and implementing concurrency), it cannot reliably implement changes due to Power Automate's specific constraints and undocumented behaviors. Key findings include successful identification of sequential processing issues and filter opportunities, but failures in actual implementation due to hallucinated actions and incorrect operation IDs. This content is based on 1 meeting transcript lasting 41 minutes 58 seconds.

**Key Decisions Made:**
- AI tools valuable for flow analysis and suggestion, not implementation
- Claude can effectively identify bottlenecks and optimization opportunities
- Manual implementation required due to Power Automate constraints
- Focus on using AI for debugging and documentation rather than direct changes

**Open Issues/Risks:**
- AI hallucinations creating non-existent Power Automate actions
- 30-minute execution time for management agreements and escalators
- Deployment time increased from 10 to 30 minutes with AI changes
- Power Automate documentation gaps leading to incorrect suggestions

**Integration Points Discussed:**
- Power Automate flows
- Contract data filtering
- SQL operations
- Deployment pipelines

## 1. POC Overview and Objectives

### 1.1. Initial POC Setup

#### 1.1.1. Claude Integration with Power Automate

**Source Document(s):** `20250616_PowerAutomate_AI_POC_1`
**Date Discussed/Decided:** `2025-06-16`
**Key Stakeholders Involved:** `Cesar Figueroa (Developer)`, `Jonathan Aulson (Business Analyst)`
**Version/Status:** `v1.0 - Completed`
**Tags:** `#POC` `#AI` `#powerautomate` `#claude` `#optimization`
**Integration Points:** `Power Automate`
**Decision Log References:** `I008`

Cesar explained the POC approach: "I have two topics to talk. The first one is related with a POC that I did on Friday and I did something on on the weekend as well. Related to trying to use client with the power automate flow, I did the POC just to illustrate what what is possible, which limitations I have."

Initial request to Claude: "Asking to client look, I have two workflows, the management agreements and escalators that I've taken too much time, some sort of 30 minutes. I need to improve that. Can you try to recognize some improvements?"

**POC Structure:**
- Created rules file for Power Automate best practices
- Provided JSON structures explaining flow architecture
- Requested optimization suggestions from Claude
- Tested implementation of suggestions

### 1.2. AI Analysis Results

#### 1.2.1. Filter Optimization Suggestions

**Source Document(s):** `20250616_PowerAutomate_AI_POC_1`
**Date Discussed/Decided:** `2025-06-16`
**Key Stakeholders Involved:** `Cesar Figueroa (Developer)`, `Jonathan Aulson (Business Analyst)`
**Version/Status:** `v1.0 - Analyzed`
**Tags:** `#optimization` `#filters` `#performance` `#contracts`
**Decision Log References:** `D015`

Cesar reported Claude's first suggestion: "And that automatically, without asking exactly or being a specific, suggested these changes in these two files basically recognize the flows and then give me some hints, for example saying look in this action. You are fetching all the contracts, so please add that. Please add filters to fetch only those contracts that have escalators and use these flags. This was the first thing that that suggests."

**Key Optimization Identified:**
- Fetching all contracts without filters
- Suggested filtering for contracts with escalators only
- Use of specific flags to reduce data set
- Potential significant performance improvement

#### 1.2.2. Concurrency Implementation Suggestion

**Source Document(s):** `20250616_PowerAutomate_AI_POC_1`
**Date Discussed/Decided:** `2025-06-16`
**Key Stakeholders Involved:** `Cesar Figueroa (Developer)`
**Version/Status:** `v1.0 - Analyzed`
**Tags:** `#optimization` `#concurrency` `#performance` `#sequential`

Cesar described the second major suggestion: "And then that's a and look you are running some sort of operations in a sequential order. That means that is and you can you can check that here on my client user... So the second topic that that explained it was that I was using an action one by one, and then instead of that, suggest to use concurrency to execute quarter of requests."

Additional insight on management flow: "What this said was something similar, but also explained it that I was doing aggregation In the logic... So this recognizes that and suggests look instead of doing through that true code, um use a single query to do the aggregation and then just reference those aggregations."

**Optimization Strategies Identified:**
1. Convert sequential operations to concurrent
2. Replace iterative aggregation with single query
3. Move calculations from flow logic to SQL
4. Reference pre-calculated values instead of computing

## 2. Implementation Challenges

### 2.1. Deployment Issues

#### 2.1.1. Performance Degradation

**Source Document(s):** `20250616_PowerAutomate_AI_POC_1`
**Date Discussed/Decided:** `2025-06-16`
**Key Stakeholders Involved:** `Cesar Figueroa (Developer)`
**Version/Status:** `v1.0 - Failed`
**Tags:** `#issue` `#deployment` `#performance` `#failure`
**Integration Points:** `Deployment Pipeline`
**Decision Log References:** `I009`

Cesar revealed concerning results: "The next step that I did on my POC was deploying that into my isolated environment and then I found some tricky results. First the pipeline change it to take. And 10 minutes, 11 minutes... So basically was taking 10 minutes. Pass from 10 minutes to 30 minutes, like three times more."

His analysis: "I'm thinking that this is happening because there are small details in the Jason that have issues and basically it's failing and we're trying some part of the deployment process."

**Impact:**
- 3x increase in deployment time
- Deployment marked as successful despite issues
- Flows unable to activate post-deployment

#### 2.1.2. Invalid Operation IDs

**Source Document(s):** `20250616_PowerAutomate_AI_POC_1`
**Date Discussed/Decided:** `2025-06-16`
**Key Stakeholders Involved:** `Cesar Figueroa (Developer)`, `Christopher Thompson (Developer)`
**Version/Status:** `v1.0 - Identified`
**Tags:** `#issue` `#technical` `#hallucination` `#powerautomate`
**Decision Log References:** `R005`

Cesar identified the root cause: "So client doesn't have a specific ideas or exact ideas in terms of the Power Automate solution. I mean the source code of Power Automate, so it's trying to use logic to apply those changes. Example is using operation ID execute SQL. This operation ID doesn't exist even that exists operation to do or to run a query."

He noted additional context: "The operation ID doesn't exist and 2nd Christopher tried to implement that action and was never successful for some reason so."

**Technical Issues:**
- Non-existent operation IDs generated
- Mismatch between AI knowledge and Power Automate reality
- Historical implementation failures not in AI context
- Undocumented Power Automate constraints

### 2.2. Tool Limitations

#### 2.2.1. Power Automate Documentation Gaps

**Source Document(s):** `20250616_PowerAutomate_AI_POC_1`
**Date Discussed/Decided:** `2025-06-16`
**Key Stakeholders Involved:** `Cesar Figueroa (Developer)`, `Christopher Thompson (Developer)`, `Jonathan Aulson (Business Analyst)`
**Version/Status:** `v1.0 - Acknowledged`
**Tags:** `#limitation` `#documentation` `#powerautomate` `#microsoft`

Cesar explained the fundamental challenge: "That's happening because client doesn't have idea of all these rules that are part of the Power Automate documentation. I don't see. Like an easy way to fetch all those records because this mean going through Microsoft docs, translate that into a Martin file, boom that file there probably we can we can, I mean."

Christopher reinforced this with examples: "You know, whatever documentation it tries to use, it is not always sound, right? There's been several situations where I'm like, you know I need a function in Power Automate to do this right, and it'll give me a function. I'll try to plug it in and you know this like the sum function or something like that for example, just isn't in power automate."

**Key Limitations:**
- Incomplete Microsoft documentation
- Undocumented function availability
- Platform-specific constraints not in AI training
- Long testing cycles (30 minutes per test)

## 3. Recommended Approach

### 3.1. AI Usage Strategy

#### 3.1.1. Analysis and Documentation Focus

**Source Document(s):** `20250616_PowerAutomate_AI_POC_1`
**Date Discussed/Decided:** `2025-06-16`
**Key Stakeholders Involved:** `Cesar Figueroa (Developer)`, `Jonathan Aulson (Business Analyst)`, `Christopher Thompson (Developer)`
**Version/Status:** `v1.0 - Approved`
**Tags:** `#strategy` `#bestpractice` `#AI` `#analysis` `#documentation`
**Decision Log References:** `D015`

Cesar provided clear recommendations: "Base it on the entire POC, my suggestion is start using the client rules to do more debugging, to explain, to fetch more details from the flows to recognize bottlenecks. But not to perform the changes because that can introduce hallucinations and unexpected results as there are a lot of internal and super specific rules in the power automation solution that can. Uh, basically impact in in the final result and can have unexpected um outputs."

Jonathan agreed: "Well, this is awesome, first of all. I I think you're my. I agree with everything I heard. It sounds like we have a tool already that can identify issues and and propose solutions, just not implement the solution."

Christopher added practical perspective: "But it can give us some good ideas that we can then, you know, use as reference and and make the change manually in our flows and test it so we can find find those errors quicker and work through it in that way."

#### 3.1.2. Flow Understanding Enhancement

**Source Document(s):** `20250616_PowerAutomate_AI_POC_1`
**Date Discussed/Decided:** `2025-06-16`
**Key Stakeholders Involved:** `Cesar Figueroa (Developer)`
**Version/Status:** `v1.0 - Demonstrated`
**Tags:** `#documentation` `#understanding` `#analysis` `#businesslogic`

Cesar demonstrated additional value: "But but look this other example I I asked the client please explain me. This is the test. Can you explain me the increment flow and that automatically switch that increment flow is this one this Jason. And it's saying this flow proposes apply rate increase to fix the services and labour hour job rates."

Claude's analysis provided:
- Flow execution schedule identification
- Business logic explanation
- Step-by-step process documentation
- Impact analysis capabilities

Cesar emphasized: "So this can be helpful to understand where my changes will impact. I don't know if that makes sense for example."

**Benefits:**
- High-level flow understanding
- Impact analysis before changes
- Business value documentation
- Context for manual optimization
