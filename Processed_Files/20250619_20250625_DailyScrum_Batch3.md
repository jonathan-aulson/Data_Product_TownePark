## 1. Billing System

### 1.1. Statement Management

#### 1.1.1. Historical Statement Generation

**Source Document(s):** `20250620_DailyScrum`
**Date Discussed/Decided:** `2025-06-20`
**Key Stakeholders Involved:** `Jonathan Aulson (Business Analyst)`, `Pratik Bedekar (Developer)`
**Version/Status:** `v1.0 - Approved`
**Tags:** `#requirement` `#billing` `#statements` `#UI`
**Decision Log References:** `D004`

Jonathan Aulson discussed Amy's request for generating historical statements:

"For Pratik, so Amy has a request out to generate old statements. I think you're aware of. I just wanted to mention on that that she is. She's also wanting to get those statements kind of essentially hidden from view once they're generated so that they're not kind of clogging up the statements table in the UI."

The request involves generating statements for past months but ensuring they don't appear in the main statements view once created.

**Implementation Details:**
- Generate statements for January through April for 157 sites
- Set appropriate status to hide the statements from the main view
- Possible approach: Set status to "sent" to remove from view

Pratik confirmed understanding: "We understood that she basically want to generate all the 157 sites January through January to April. All the statements again and... She want that we we should not click on the send button so that it it it should send to the client and it creates a mess up."

**Key Requirements:**
- Generate historical statements for validation purposes
- Ensure statements are not sent to clients
- Hide generated statements from main UI to prevent clutter
- Maintain accessibility of statements through customer details view

### 1.2. User Interface

#### 1.2.1. Month Change Dialog Improvement

**Source Document(s):** `20250619_DailyScrum`
**Date Discussed/Decided:** `2025-06-19`
**Key Stakeholders Involved:** `Jonathan Aulson (Business Analyst)`, `Gayasuddin Gayasi (Tester)`
**Version/Status:** `v1.0 - Low Priority`
**Tags:** `#issue` `#UI` `#UX` `#forecasting`
**Decision Log References:** `I007`

Gayasuddin Gayasi identified a potential issue with the UI dialog when changing months:

"And that rates changes that we have done previously before changing the month. It's still there."

The issue involves the wording of the dialog that appears when changing months with unsaved changes. The dialog states "changes will be lost if you continue" but the actual behavior is that the changes remain in the UI but aren't automatically saved.

**Dialog Text Issue:**
- Current text: "Changes will be lost if you continue, your changes will be lost if you continue"
- Actual behavior: Changes are retained in the UI but not saved to the database

Jonathan's assessment: "That is, that is in this use case, this text is a business meeting. I'm gonna mark this a low priority bug and we'll we'll think about how to tweak that messaging to be something a little less confusing."

**Next Steps:**
- Revise dialog text to better reflect the actual behavior
- Low priority fix due to minimal impact on functionality

## 2. System Architecture and Process

### 2.1. Documentation and Planning

#### 2.1.1. Process Workflow Documentation

**Source Document(s):** `20250620_DailyScrum`
**Date Discussed/Decided:** `2025-06-20`
**Key Stakeholders Involved:** `Jonathan Aulson (Business Analyst)`, `Cesar Figueroa`
**Version/Status:** `v1.0 - Approved`
**Tags:** `#documentation` `#process` `#technical`
**Decision Log References:** `D005`

A discussion about documenting system workflows and interactions:

Cesar requested: "And at the end describe if it's possible... workflow where these actions will interact? Something like that."

After some clarification, they settled on: "Describe if it's possible the workflow where these objects interact" or "Describe if possible the process where these objects will interact."

This pertains to creating documentation that explains how different system components interact with each other.

**Documentation Output:**
- Jonathan suggested: "AI to generate a solution... diagram with... and it details"
- Cesar confirmed this would be helpful
- The output will be put in Eraser for review

**Implementation Details:**
- Use AI to generate initial solution diagrams
- Include process flows showing object interactions
- Review in Eraser tool for team feedback

#### 2.1.2. Sprint Architecture Planning

**Source Document(s):** `20250620_DailyScrum`
**Date Discussed/Decided:** `2025-06-20`
**Key Stakeholders Involved:** `Jonathan Aulson (Business Analyst)`, `Cesar Figueroa`
**Version/Status:** `v1.0 - Approved`
**Tags:** `#planning` `#process` `#technical`
**Decision Log References:** `D005`

Jonathan introduced a new process step based on sprint retrospective feedback:

"I guess just a kind of general announcement here. We in our Sprint retro we determined there was a new step in our process. We wanted to start taking and that's going to be to compare across all of our user stories for kind of detecting common changes for the solution architecture and then designing a diagram based on that to guide the Sprint."

This new process involves analyzing all sprint user stories to identify common architectural changes and creating a guiding diagram.

**Process Implementation:**
- Review all user stories for the sprint
- Identify common architectural changes
- Create a solution diagram to guide development
- Meet with Cesar to determine the best format

**Key Benefits:**
- Provide better architectural guidance for the sprint
- Identify potential integration points or conflicts early
- Improve overall solution design

### 2.2. Environment Management

#### 2.2.1. Environment Replication for PLH Sites

**Source Document(s):** `20250619_DailyScrum`
**Date Discussed/Decided:** `2025-06-19`
**Key Stakeholders Involved:** `Cesar Figueroa`
**Version/Status:** `v1.0 - In Progress`
**Tags:** `#technical` `#integration` `#database` `#replication`
**Decision Log References:** `I009`

Cesar Figueroa reported on environment replication work:

"Then I had a meeting with Diane. We reviewed the content of the copy that I did as the testing for the rest of the 2025 periods. Looks like for now, only per labor hour is missing."

The team is working on replicating environment data, with Per Labor Hour (PLH) sites being the only remaining component not yet replicated.

**Technical Implementation Details:**
- Copy operation for 2025 periods has been tested
- PLH (Per Labor Hour) sites data is still missing
- Working with Diane to get a validation query
- Planning to identify dependencies needed to complete the PLH data copying

**Next Steps:**
- "He is planning to give me a query. The query that he will use to validate that data and I will use that query to see which dependencies are missing to fill in order to copy the the QA data."
- Continue with "duplicate based on copy" implementation

## 3. System Performance and Fixes

### 3.1. Performance Issues

#### 3.1.1. Save API Performance Issue

**Source Document(s):** `20250625_DailyScrum`
**Date Discussed/Decided:** `2025-06-25`
**Key Stakeholders Involved:** `Andrew Scheuer (Developer)`, `Gayasuddin Gayasi (Tester)`
**Version/Status:** `v1.0 - Open Issue`
**Tags:** `#issue` `#technical` `#performance` `#API`
**Decision Log References:** `I008`

Andrew Scheuer reported a performance issue with the save API:

"The only one that wasn't fixed was the API response when we do save all taking like 30 seconds. And that that hasn't affected me. Tried breaking it up in the front end to three separate calls with those, each took 30 seconds."

This issue involves slow response times (approximately 30 seconds) when using the "save all" API functionality.

**Technical Details:**
- Save All API call takes approximately 30 seconds to complete
- Attempted to break into three separate calls, but each still took 30 seconds
- Issue remains unresolved but is not blocking current work

**Potential Approaches:**
- Further investigation into database performance
- API optimization
- Potential asynchronous processing

### 3.2. Bug Fixes

#### 3.2.1. Starting Month Reset Fix

**Source Document(s):** `20250625_DailyScrum`
**Date Discussed/Decided:** `2025-06-25`
**Key Stakeholders Involved:** `Andrew Scheuer (Developer)`, `Gayasuddin Gayasi (Tester)`
**Version/Status:** `v1.0 - Completed`
**Tags:** `#issue` `#technical` `#UI` `#bugfix`

Andrew Scheuer confirmed a fix for an issue with the starting month not being reset:

"And and the one that you had in question regarding the starting month be not being reset. That's been fixed as well and we we set that that was a bug. So we we set the starting month to the to the the queried month."

This issue involved the starting month not properly resetting to the queried month when performing certain operations.

**Fix Implementation:**
- Identified as a bug and properly categorized
- Fixed by setting the starting month to match the queried month
- Successfully verified by Gayasuddin Gayasi
