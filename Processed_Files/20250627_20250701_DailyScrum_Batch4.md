## 1. Billing System

### 1.1. Statement Generation

#### 1.1.1. Historical Statement Generation

**Source Document(s):** `20250627_DailyScrum`, `20250630_DailyScrum`
**Date Discussed/Decided:** `2025-06-27` to `2025-06-30`
**Key Stakeholders Involved:** `Shravan Modi (Developer)`, `Jonathan Aulson (Business Analyst)`, `Pratik Bedekar (Developer)`
**Version/Status:** `v1.0 - Completed`
**Tags:** `#billing` `#statements` `#technical` `#implementation`
**Decision Log References:** `D006` `D007` `I010`

Shravan Modi reported completing the generation of prior month statements:

"So today I was continuing working on generating the prior month statement for the remaining remaining sites on on that list. So I have I have finished with all the mentioned site by Amy and generated all the prior month statement."

The team successfully generated historical statements for all requested sites, with a small number experiencing issues.

**Technical Implementation Details:**
- Successfully generated statements for all sites requested by Amy
- Identified an issue during generation that required discussion
- Implemented solution for hiding older statements from the UI

On June 30, Pratik Bedekar provided an update on statement generation status:

"The we got the 157 sites in this Excel and out of those only five got error. So we are sure that 150 documents will definitely work because we were able to generate the January through April straight away."

**Issues and Resolution:**
- 152 of 157 sites processed successfully
- 5 sites experienced errors during generation
- Team is confident that July statements will work for the successful sites

Jonathan also clarified the urgency of threshold review:

"Amy has a task, right? She has to review the amounts on all of those invoices and validate that, uh, they're correct... So that the threshold amounts will be correct... from here on out and I'm trying to figure out do I do I have to tell her that she has to review those today and and get it done or does she have more time and I think she has more time."

**Decision:**
- Amy has time to review statement thresholds, not urgent
- If issues are found, statements can be regenerated

#### 1.1.2. Statement Visibility Rules

**Source Document(s):** `20250701_DailyScrum`
**Date Discussed/Decided:** `2025-07-01`
**Key Stakeholders Involved:** `Jonathan Aulson (Business Analyst)`, `Christopher Thompson (Developer)`, `Pratik Bedekar (Developer)`
**Version/Status:** `v1.0 - Confirmed`
**Tags:** `#billing` `#statements` `#UI` `#technical`
**Decision Log References:** `D008`

A detailed discussion about statement visibility rules in the UI:

Jonathan Aulson observed: "Yes. So that's the logic built into this view. So it will because it's July 1st, May statements are now hidden. So what we do is we show last month and this month."

Christopher Thompson confirmed: "Right. Yeah. So if the, I think it's tied to the... That the billing, it's either the billing cycle or the service period. But basically if it's if it's not a statement that was generated like this month, right. So you said the May statement which was generated in June. Now that it's July, if it's in a if it was a sent status, it's removed from this list."

This clarifies how statement visibility works in the system - statements older than the previous month are hidden from the main view if they are in "sent" status.

**Technical Implementation Details:**
- Statements from the current month and previous month are always visible
- Older statements in "sent" status are hidden from the main list view
- Statements remain accessible through the Customers tab and customer details

**Access Alternative:**
- "However, you can still go if you go to the Customers tab and you view the customer details for 0480... and then view that and then go to the statements tab on here. You will still see [the statement]."

### 1.2. Monitoring and Alerting

#### 1.2.1. Alerting Implementation

**Source Document(s):** `20250630_DailyScrum`
**Date Discussed/Decided:** `2025-06-30`
**Key Stakeholders Involved:** `Jonathan Aulson (Business Analyst)`, `Pratik Bedekar (Developer)`
**Version/Status:** `v1.0 - In Progress`
**Tags:** `#technical` `#monitoring` `#alerts` `#implementation`
**Integration Points:** `Dataverse`

Jonathan Aulson acknowledged receiving monitoring documentation:

"Let's see, I need Pratik. I I I received the alerting and monitoring and alerting spreadsheet you sent, which is great."

This indicates the team is working on implementing monitoring and alerting capabilities, with Pratik having prepared documentation on the approach.

**Implementation Status:**
- Documentation on monitoring and alerting approach completed
- Spreadsheet prepared outlining alerting requirements
- Implementation likely in progress but details not specified in the transcript

## 2. Forecasting System

### 2.1. Payroll Data Visualization

#### 2.1.1. Daily Hours Visualization Issue

**Source Document(s):** `20250701_DailyScrum`
**Date Discussed/Decided:** `2025-07-01`
**Key Stakeholders Involved:** `Gayasuddin Gayasi (Tester)`, `Christopher Thompson (Developer)`, `Jonathan Aulson (Business Analyst)`
**Version/Status:** `v1.0 - Open Issue`
**Tags:** `#issue` `#forecasting` `#payroll` `#UI` `#display`
**Decision Log References:** `I011`

Gayasuddin Gayasi identified an issue with the daily hours visualization:

"For GSA if you see it's showing for for this week it is 15 hours, but for GSA it's different for every day, so I don't know how to calculate this."

Jonathan elaborated: "For GSGSC, the number in black is 15 hours, but that doesn't track with a monthly actual of 334."

The issue concerns inconsistency in how daily payroll hours are displayed, particularly for GSA and GSC job codes.

**Technical Context:**
- The system shows "15 hours" for GSC, which doesn't align with the monthly actual of 334 hours
- For GSA, the hours displayed vary by day
- When hovering over a date, a summary shows combined hours for all job codes

Christopher Thompson provided insight: "Well, let me yeah and and I can add to the story the the the database queries so you can look at them because because actual and scheduled data we actually get a a a daily granularity, right. So we know which days we're not taking like the full month and dividing it by 30."

**Resolution Approach:**
- Christopher will add the database queries to the story for reference
- This will help determine how the daily values are being calculated
- Further investigation needed to understand the calculation methodology

## 3. Development Operations

Shravan Modi reported on forecast bug fixes being worked on by the team:

"From the team side Kajal was work Kajal, Kajal was verifying one of the issue while saving the forecast as Cesar as Cesar had made some changes on that part but still it is not working. She already informed him. That, she told me. And apart from it, she was working, started working on forecast bug 2316 and which is now fixed and she raised [PR]"

The team is actively addressing forecast-related bugs, with specific mention of bug #2316 being fixed.
