# Sprint 30 Forecasting Variance Indicators Implementation

## Meeting Overview

**Date**: July 10, 2025  
**Meeting Type**: Sprint Tasking Session  
**Duration**: Approximately 47 minutes  
**Primary Focus**: Variance indicator enhancements and development workflow improvements

### Participants
- **Cesar Figueroa** - Technical Lead
- **Graham Olson** - Developer
- **Andrew Scheuer** - Developer/Architect
- **Christopher Thompson** - Senior Developer
- **Jonathan Aulson** - Product Owner/Business Analyst
- **Javier Casas** - Developer

## Executive Summary

This focused sprint planning session addressed enhancements to the forecasting variance table functionality, specifically expanding variance indicators to additional columns beyond the current "actual to budget" column. The team also established improved development workflow procedures for feature branch management.

## Key Technical Decisions

### 1. Variance Indicator Expansion

**Current State**: Variance indicators only displayed on "actual to budget" column

**Enhancement Decision**: Add variance indicators to additional comparison columns
- **Excluded**: Budget vs Budget comparison (no variance expected)
- **Included**: All other variance comparison columns
- **Implementation**: Extend existing variance indicator logic to additional columns

**Business Justification**: Improved visibility into forecast accuracy across multiple comparison dimensions

### 2. Development Workflow Enhancement

**New Requirement**: Add feature branch merge tasks to all user stories

**Implementation Process**:
- Add "Merge feature branch to develop" task to all user stories
- Serves as final sign-off that changes are deployed to develop branch
- Ensures consistent deployment tracking across all development work

**Responsibility**: Andrew Scheuer to add merge tasks to all user stories

## Technical Implementation Details

### Variance Indicator Logic

**Current Implementation**: 
- Single column variance calculation
- Comparison between actual and budget values
- Visual indicators (arrows/colors) for variance direction

**Enhanced Implementation**:
- Multi-column variance support
- Maintain existing calculation logic
- Extend UI components to support additional columns
- Preserve budget vs budget exclusion logic

### User Interface Enhancements

**Scope**: Update variance table display to show indicators across multiple columns

**Technical Approach**:
- Leverage existing variance calculation components
- Extend column configuration to include variance indicator flags
- Maintain consistent visual design patterns

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Variance indicators appear on all relevant comparison columns
- Budget vs Budget column remains without indicators
- Existing functionality preserved
- Visual consistency maintained

## Development Workflow Improvements

### Feature Branch Management

**New Standard Process**:
1. Complete feature development in feature branch
2. Perform code review and testing
3. Execute merge to develop branch
4. Mark merge task as complete

**Benefits**:
- Clear deployment tracking
- Consistent workflow across all features
- Improved visibility into development progress
- Better coordination between team members

### Task Management Enhancement

**Implementation**: Add merge task to all user stories in current sprint

**Task Template**:
- **Task Name**: "Merge feature branch to develop"
- **Description**: "Merge completed feature branch to develop branch after code review and testing"
- **Acceptance Criteria**: "Feature branch successfully merged to develop with no conflicts"

## Sprint 30 Scope

### Primary User Story
- **Focus**: Variance indicator enhancement
- **Complexity**: Low to Medium
- **Estimated Effort**: Minimal (leveraging existing components)

### Secondary Improvements
- **Workflow Enhancement**: Feature branch merge task addition
- **Process Standardization**: Consistent deployment tracking

## Technical Considerations

### Existing Component Reuse
- Leverage current variance calculation logic
- Extend existing UI components rather than creating new ones
- Maintain backward compatibility with current variance display

### Testing Requirements
- Verify variance indicators appear on correct columns
- Confirm budget vs budget exclusion works properly
- Test visual consistency across all variance columns
- Validate existing functionality remains intact

## Implementation Timeline

**Estimated Duration**: 1-2 development cycles

**Key Milestones**:
1. **Analysis**: Review existing variance indicator implementation
2. **Enhancement**: Extend logic to additional columns
3. **Testing**: Verify functionality across all variance scenarios
4. **Deployment**: Merge to develop branch following new workflow

## Quality Assurance

### Testing Scope
- **Functional Testing**: Variance calculations across all columns
- **Visual Testing**: Indicator display consistency
- **Regression Testing**: Existing variance functionality
- **User Acceptance Testing**: Business user validation of enhancements

### Acceptance Criteria
- Variance indicators display on all non-budget comparison columns
- Budget vs Budget column shows no variance indicators
- Visual design maintains consistency with existing patterns
- No regression in existing variance functionality

## Code Validation Requirements

**Validation Scope**: Variance calculation logic and UI component behavior

**Source Code Locations**:
- Forecasting variance calculation components
- UI variance indicator display logic
- Column configuration and rendering components

**Validation Process**: Verify enhanced variance indicator logic matches business requirements and maintains consistency with existing calculation patterns.
