## Executive Summary

This document captures key decisions about how actuals will be displayed across different forecasting tabs. The meeting occurred during extreme heat (over 100Â°F) with Amy Sowells and Mike Foy absent. Critical decisions were made about actuals display methodology, with rates and other expenses showing actuals in a second row, while statistics will replace values.

**Open Issues/Risks:**
- HRIS data quality issues with employee role transitions
- Terminated employees appearing in security tables
- Meeting frequency concerns for project completion
- Guy (stakeholder) scheduling challenges

**Integration Points Discussed:**
- HRIS/Workday integration for employee data
- EDW for actuals data
- Legion for scheduled hours

Jonathan initiated the discussion: "So I thought I wanted to. Kind of go back through some of these stuff we we talked about last week related to. Showing actuals and how we're gonna show variance. I just wanted to kind of recap everything."

Initial confusion was quickly resolved:
Jonathan: "We want to show actuals, kind of replacing the values. In in the cells as opposed to like showing them. Oh no. Actually, I take that back. I think on on one of the tabs. Actually I think we said we did want it in addition."

Adam clarified: "I think other expense was in addition, statistics was over, right?"

Jonathan confirmed: "Yeah. OK. Let me make sure I've got that."

Adam added: "And I think rates rates was in addition as well."

**Tags:** `#issue` `#HRIS` `#data` `#payroll` `#workday`
**Integration Points:** `HRIS` `Workday`
**Decision Log References:** `I013`

Jonathan explained a critical data issue: "Yeah, that's that's like the. That was the piece that led us here from the last review. We were trying to work with was we just didn't have a way to, like, reliably understand when. When an employee was was not in a role like we can see when they kind of entered a role, but then it it they never left is kind of what the data made it appear."

He also noted data quality issues: "Right where an employee has more than one cost center, he's we've got these blanks so. I get. You know, I'm assuming we just are meant to take this data. For this row."

Adam agreed: "Yeah, I think that's the case."

#### 2.1.2. Terminated Employee Data

Jonathan identified a specific issue: "These these folks show up when I, when I look in the the work day. Rls by security table, but they don't show up in this report, so just trying to find out you know where these guys are or what what the reasoning is there."

Adam hypothesized: "Yeah, I don't know why they would be. I wonder if they were their terminated employees and they weren't weren't terminated correctly. Yeah, that doesn't make. Should match, at least in my opinion."

Jonathan agreed: "Yeah, that that. OK, that's kind of where I was headed with it too. I we just need to understand what's going on there."

## 3. Steering Committee Preparation

Concerned about? Maybe not as like a risk, but something that we think like there's a potential that we would need to meet on more frequently to finish. Or are we overall he[aded in the right direction]?"

Adam: "It's getting pretty supposed to be pretty bad this week... some massive heat waves supposed to cool down and like, the back half of the week with some rain. But trying to stay, stay inside this week."

This context explains the reduced attendance (Amy and Mike absent) and potentially impacts team productivity during this period.
