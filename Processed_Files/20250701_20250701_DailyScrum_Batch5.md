## 1. Forecasting System

### 1.1. Payroll Data

#### 1.1.1. Payroll Data Query Implementation

**Source Document(s):** `20250701_DailyScrum_Additional`
**Date Discussed/Decided:** `2025-07-01`
**Key Stakeholders Involved:** `Christopher Thompson (Developer)`, `Gayasuddin Gayasi (Tester)`, `Jonathan Aulson (Business Analyst)`
**Version/Status:** `v1.0 - In Progress`
**Tags:** `#technical` `#forecasting` `#payroll` `#data` `#query`
**Integration Points:** `Database Queries`
**Decision Log References:** `D009`

Christopher Thompson elaborated on the implementation of payroll data queries:

"And and I can add to the story the the the database queries so you can look at them because because actual and scheduled data we actually get a a a daily granularity, right. So we know which days we're not taking like the full month and dividing it by 30 or 31 or whatever. We're actually running a query that gets us info for every day."

This clarifies how the system retrieves and processes payroll data at a daily granularity level.

**Technical Implementation Details:**
- Database queries retrieve data at daily granularity
- System is not simply dividing monthly totals by days in month
- Specific queries mentioned: "payroll schedule, payroll actuals"
- Christopher will add these queries to the user story for reference

**Next Steps:**
- Add database queries to the user story
- Team to review queries to understand calculation methodology
- Resolve any discrepancies in how data is displayed

### 1.2. User Interface Components

#### 1.2.1. Payroll Data Hover Functionality

**Source Document(s):** `20250701_DailyScrum_Additional`
**Date Discussed/Decided:** `2025-07-01`
**Key Stakeholders Involved:** `Christopher Thompson (Developer)`, `Gayasuddin Gayasi (Tester)`
**Version/Status:** `v1.0 - Clarification`
**Tags:** `#UI` `#UX` `#forecasting` `#payroll` `#display`

Christopher Thompson explained the hover functionality for payroll data:

"Oh, so if you hover over the whole day, like on Monday, June 2nd, go up. There you go. So that shows like the full scheduled for all the job codes combined for actual and scheduled."

Jonathan noted a potential inconsistency: "Which if you look at the, if you look at the roll up right for them for Monday, June 2nd, 136.1 hover over Mondays again. So we're showing actual there. So then my assumption would be that we are showing in the black text we're showing we should be showing the actual number all the way down and then showing budget next to it."

This discussion clarifies how the hover functionality works and identifies a potential inconsistency in how data is displayed in the UI.

**User Interface Behavior:**
- Hovering over a date shows combined hours for all job codes
- Shows both actual and scheduled hours in the hover display
- Regular display appears to show different values than what would be expected

**Issue Identified:**
- Display values in black text don't seem consistent with the monthly actuals
- For GSC, displaying 15 hours doesn't align with monthly actual of 334 hours
- GSA shows different values for each day

## 2. Billing System

### 2.1. Statement Management

#### 2.1.1. Accessing Older Statements

**Source Document(s):** `20250701_DailyScrum_Additional`
**Date Discussed/Decided:** `2025-07-01`
**Key Stakeholders Involved:** `Christopher Thompson (Developer)`, `Jonathan Aulson (Business Analyst)`
**Version/Status:** `v1.0 - Confirmed`
**Tags:** `#billing` `#statements` `#UI` `#navigation`
**Integration Points:** `Customer Details`
**Decision Log References:** `D010`

Christopher Thompson explained how to access older statements that are hidden from the main view:

"However, you can still go if you go to the Customers tab and you view the customer details for 0480... and then view that and then go to the statements tab on here. You will still see [the statement]."

This confirms that older statements remain accessible through the customer details view, even when they're hidden from the main statements list.

**Navigation Path:**
1. Go to Customers tab
2. Find and select the customer (e.g., 0480)
3. Click to view customer details
4. Navigate to the Statements tab within customer details
5. All statements for that customer will be visible, including older ones

**Technical Implementation:**
- Main statements view filters out older statements in "sent" status
- Customer details view shows all statements regardless of age
- This design balances UI cleanliness with data accessibility
