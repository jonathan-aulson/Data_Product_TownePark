## Purpose of the Billing and Forecasting Project for Towne Park

### Project Overview
Towne Park has partnered with Allata to modernize its financial systems through two key, interconnected projects:

1.  **Billing System (Power Bill/Project Mercury):** Completed/In Progress
2.  **Forecasting System:** Currently in development

These projects signify a strategic overhaul of Towne Park's financial operations, transitioning from manual, Excel-reliant processes to integrated, cloud-based solutions leveraging Microsoft Power Platform and Azure.

### Business Challenges Being Addressed

#### Legacy System Limitations
Prior to these initiatives, Towne Park faced substantial operational hurdles:
*   **Excel Dependency:** Financial operations were heavily reliant on complex, interconnected spreadsheets with intricate macros that were difficult to maintain and prone to errors.
*   **Manual Processes:** Account Managers were tasked with manually entering daily revenue and operational data, a process that was both time-consuming and susceptible to inaccuracies.
*   **Data Integrity Issues:** The lack of robust controls within Excel led to data inaccuracies, diminishing confidence in financial reporting and analysis.
*   **Operational Inefficiencies:** The billing cycle consumed a significant portion of the month (nearly half), delaying the closing of the general ledger and impacting financial agility.
*   **Limited Scalability:** The existing manual system struggled to accommodate Towne Park's expanding operations (over 700 customer sites) and its strategic acquisition goals.
*   **Forecasting Pain Points:** Forecasting was hampered by disconnected data sources, delayed updates, tedious manual calculations, and an inability to quickly assess the impact of changes, often resulting in inaccurate forecasts.

#### Competitive Pressures
Towne Park operates within a competitive landscape where operational efficiency, data accuracy, and system scalability are crucial differentiators. High-profile clients, such as Disneyland, demand seamless operations and timely, precise billing. The presence of competitors offering more modern, automated solutions posed a potential threat to Towne Park's market standing.

### Project Goals & Objectives

#### Billing System (Power Bill)
*   **Modernization & Efficiency:** Replace manual, Excel-based invoicing with a streamlined, automated system.
*   **Accuracy Improvement:** Minimize errors in data collection, processing, and the generation of invoices.
*   **Data Centralization:** Establish Dataverse as the single, authoritative source of truth for contracts and billing data.
*   **Process Acceleration:** Dramatically reduce the time required to complete billing cycles and close the general ledger.
*   **Scalability:** Create a robust platform capable of supporting continued business growth and future acquisitions.
*   **Client Satisfaction:** Deliver professional, accurate, and timely invoices to enhance client relationships.

#### Forecasting System
*   **Shift Focus from Input to Output:** Reduce the time users spend on data entry and reconciliation, allowing them to concentrate on analyzing forecasts and taking proactive business actions.
*   **Improve Accuracy & Timeliness:** Provide more reliable forecasts with faster feedback loops and up-to-date information.
*   **Enable Proactive Management:** Equip users at all organizational levels with tools to anticipate potential issues, model various scenarios, and drive performance improvements.
*   **Simplify User Experience:** Create an intuitive and user-friendly interface that is significantly easier to use than the current Excel files, especially for new Account Managers.
*   **Automate Data Integration:** Automatically pull data from source systems (e.g., EDW, Legion, Power Bill) to minimize manual data entry and ensure consistency.
*   **Provide Real-Time Insights:** Enable access to near real-time actuals and forecast data to facilitate better and faster decision-making.
*   **Support All Contract Types:** Handle the complexities of Towne Park's diverse contract structures, including the "10 Percenter" complex deals.

### Key Benefits
The modernization initiative is expected to deliver significant advantages:

*   **Increased Efficiency:** Automation of billing and forecasting processes will free up valuable resources, allowing staff to focus on more strategic and value-added tasks.
*   **Improved Accuracy:** Reduction in manual data entry and the implementation of standardized calculations will ensure more reliable and trustworthy financial data.

*   **Scalability:** The cloud-based solution is designed to handle Towne Park's current and future growth, adapting to evolving business needs.
*   **Enhanced Client Satisfaction:** More accurate and timely processes will improve Towne Park's ability to meet and exceed client expectations.
*   **Data Integration:** Centralized data will enable better analytics, comprehensive reporting, and a holistic view of the business.

### Current Status
*   **Billing System:** Largely implemented, with **556 out of 771 sites** transitioned to the new system as of the latest reporting.
*   **Forecasting System:** In active development, with a projected completion date of **October 2025**.
