# Coding Guidelines for Frontend and Backend

## General Standards
- Follow consistent naming conventions for files, classes, and functions.
- Maintain clear and concise documentation for all components and services.
- Prioritize code readability and maintainability over cleverness or premature optimization.
- Treat code as a long-term asset: write it for the next developer (or future you).
- Code must be modular, reusable, and maintainable, with each class, function, or component having a clear, single responsibility and adheres to DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself), KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid), and YAGNI (You Arenâ€™t Gonna Need It) principles.
- Use abstraction and interfaces to decouple high-level logic from low-level implementation details, enabling flexibility and easier testing.
- Design solutions that are easy to reason about and adapt over time, prioritizing readability and long-term quality over short-term convenience.
- Leverage design patterns and architectural best practices where they add clarity or solve recurring problems effectively.


## Project Structure
- The project root contains the React client application.
- The /src folder stores the Azure Functions (.NET API).

### Mapping and DTOs
- Use Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) to define the shape of data being passed between components and services.
- Implement mapping functions to convert between DTOs and domain models.

### Mapping and VOs/DTOs
- All Value Objects (VOs) and Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) must be placed in their respective folders:
  - VOs in `src/Models/Vo/`
  - DTOs in `src/Models/Dto/`
- Ensure namespaces for VOs and DTOs reflect their folder structure, e.g., `namespace api.Models.Vo` for VOs and `namespace api.Models.Dto` for DTOs.
- Adapters should handle mapping between VOs and DTOs, keeping business logic in services.
- For service adapters, avoid injecting mappers or services via dependency injection. Instead, instantiate mappers directly within adapter methods as needed, similar to the pattern used in `JobCodeServiceAdapter`.

#### Naming Principles
- Use lowercase with hyphens for readability; camelCase for multiple words.
- In iterations, include an optional iteration index to keep the ID unique.
- Be descriptive but concise.
- Avoid redundant words.

#### Best Practices
- Consistency is key across the entire application.
- Prioritize semantic meaning over technical implementation.
- Update IDs if a component's purpose significantly changes.

## Backend (.NET)

### Architecture Overview

The backend is organized as a layered Azure Functions application, following Clean Architecture principles for maintainability and scalability. Each layer has a clear responsibility and communicates only with adjacent layers.

#### Layer Responsibilities

- **Function/API Layer (`Functions/`):**  
  Exposes HTTP endpoints as Azure Functions. Handles request validation, calls service adapters, and returns DTOs. No business or data access logic.

- **Adapter Layer (`Adapters/`, `Adapters/Mappers/`):**  
  Bridges between the API and service layers.  
  - *Service Adapters:* Accept/return DTOs, call the service layer, and map between DTOs and VOs.  
  - *Mappers:* Use [Mapperly](https://mapperly.riok.app/) for all mapping between domain models, VOs, and DTOs.  
  No business logic.

- **Service Layer (`Services/`, `Services/Impl/`):**  
  Contains business logic and orchestrates operations. Coordinates between repositories and adapters.

- **Repository Layer (`Data/`, `Data/Impl/`):**  
  Handles all data access and persistence (Dataverse, SQL, etc.). Exposes CRUD and query methods. No business logic.

- **Domain Models & Shared Types (`Models/`):**  
  - `Models/Vo/`: Value Objects for business logic  
  - `Models/Dto/`: Data Transfer Objects for API contracts  
  - `Models/Enums/`: Enumerations for shared types  
  - `Models/Common/`: Shared/common models (e.g., query definitions)

- **Helpers & Middleware:**  
  - `Helpers/`: Utility classes  
  - `Middleware/`: Cross-cutting concerns (e.g., authentication)

- **Configuration:**  
  - `Config/`: Application configuration classes

### Coding Guidelines

- **Separation of Concerns:** Each layer has a single responsibility.
- **Mapping:** All mapping is currently done manually using custom helper functions.
- **Dependency Injection:** Use constructor injection for all dependencies.
- **No Business Logic in Functions/Adapters/Repositories:** Keep business rules in the service layer.
- **Consistent Naming:** Follow established naming conventions for files, classes, and functions.
- **Testing:** Write unit tests for all services and functions.

### Feature Implementation Flow

When creating a new backend feature:

1. **Define Data Models:** Create or update DTOs and VOs in `Models/Dto/` and `Models/Vo/`.
2. **Repository:** Create interface and implementation in `Data/` and `Data/Impl/`.
3. **Service:** Add interface and implementation in `Services/` and `Services/Impl/`.
4. **Adapter & Mapper:** Add service adapter and mappers in `Adapters/` and `Adapters/Mappers/`.
5. **Function:** Add Azure Function in `Functions/`.
6. **EDWQueryRegistry Update:**  
   - Add a new `EDWQueryDefinition` to `Models/Common/EDWQueryRegistry.cs`.
   - Specify the following properties:
     - `Id`: Unique identifier for the query/feature.
     - `NameOrSql`: The SQL statement or name for the query.
     - `CommandType`: The command type (e.g., Text, StoredProcedure).
     - `Mapper`: The Mapperly-generated mapper to convert results to the correct model.
   - This is the only change required in the registry when introducing a new query, once your data models are defined.
7. **Testing:** Add unit tests for each layer.

---

### EDWQueryRegistry Instructions

- **Purpose:** Central registry for all EDW queries used by the application.
- **How to Add a Query:**
  1. Define the necessary DTOs/VOs for your feature.
  2. Add a new `EDWQueryDefinition` entry in `Models/Common/EDWQueryRegistry.cs` with:
     - `Id`: Unique string identifier.
     - `NameOrSql`: SQL or stored procedure name.
     - `CommandType`: Command type (e.g., `CommandType.Text`).
     - `Mapper`: Reference to the Mapperly mapper for result mapping.
  3. No other changes to the registry are required for new features.

---

### Data Access

- Use Entity Framework for data access and ensure proper use of migrations.
- Implement repository patterns to abstract data access logic.


### Mapping and VOs (Required Practice)

- Use Value Objects (VOs) to encapsulate domain logic and ensure immutability.
- **All mapping between domain models, VOs, and DTOs must be performed using [Mapperly](https://mapperly.riok.app/).**
- Do not write manual mapping code or use any other mapping libraries.
- Define all mapping logic in dedicated Mapperly mapper classes.
- Use `[Mapper]` and `[MapProperty]` attributes to configure mappings as needed.
- If a new mapping is required for a feature, create or extend a Mapperly mapper class for that feature.
- All adapters and services must delegate mapping responsibilities to Mapperly-generated mappers.
