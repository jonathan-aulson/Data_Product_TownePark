		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/20141101/DatesAndTimes/BusinessDates/ version of this ontology was revised by the FIBO FND 1.2 RTF in order to add definitions for business recurrence intervals such as the day of the month and week, and to revise the representation of the end of the month to correspond to the way that the other intervals are represented for use in parametric schedules.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/20180801/DatesAndTimes/BusinessDates/ version of this ontology was revised to better support definitions related to business day adjustments.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/20180901/DatesAndTimes/BusinessDates/ version of this ontology was revised to loosen domains on properties related to business day and day count (recurrence interval) conventions, eliminate a duplicate individual, normalize definitions to be ISO 704 compliant, eliminate duplication of concepts in LCC, move hasBusinessCenter to locations, where the class BusinessCenter is defined and merge countries with locations.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/20200301/DatesAndTimes/BusinessDates/ version of this ontology was revised to eliminate a remaining circular definition.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/20210201/DatesAndTimes/BusinessDates/ version of this ontology was revised to address hygiene issues with respect to text processing.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/20220701/DatesAndTimes/BusinessDates.rdf version of the ontology was modified to use the Commons Ontology Library (Commons) Annotation Vocabulary rather than the OMG&apos;s Specification Metadata vocabulary.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/20230101/DatesAndTimes/BusinessDates.rdf version of this ontology was modified to use the Commons Ontology Library (Commons) rather than the OMG&apos;s Languages, Countries and Codes (LCC), eliminating redundancies in FIBO as appropriate.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/20230301/DatesAndTimes/BusinessDates.rdf version of this ontology was modified to replace content that is now available in the OMG Commons Ontology Library (Commons) v1.1 (FND-380).</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/20240101/DatesAndTimes/BusinessDates.rdf version of this ontology was modified to eliminate elements that have been deprecated for several quarters (FND-386).</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/20240101/DatesAndTimes/BusinessDates.rdf version of this ontology was modified to reconcile business day adjustments with business day conventions, which are synonymous (SEC-150).</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/20250201/DatesAndTimes/BusinessDates.rdf version of the ontology was modified to replace additional content that is now available in the OMG Commons Ontology Library (Commons) v1.2 (FND-389).</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>This ontology was added to Foundations in advance of the December 2014 Long Beach meeting in support of the SEC specification. It is also needed to provide temporal relationships for Ownership and Control.

These three ontologies are designed for use together:

	* FinancialDates -- financial Dates and Schedules
	* BusinessDates -- business day adjustments
	* Occurrences -- occurrences (events) and kinds of occurrences

They are modularized this way to minimize the ontological committments that are imposed upon ontologies that rely upon them. Ontologies can import FinancialDates alone, or FinancialDates + BusinessDates, or FinancialDates + Occurrences, or all three together.</skos:changeNote>

		<cmns-av:adaptedFrom>https://www.actusfrf.org/dictionary</cmns-av:adaptedFrom>
		<cmns-av:explanatoryNote>Business day conventions are linked to a calendar. Calendars have working and non-working days. In the ACTUS dictionary, the rules related to business day conventions (BDCs) state that a BDC value other than N means that cash flows cannot fall on non-working days, they must be shifted to the next business day (following) or the previous on (preceding). These two simple rules get refined twofold: (1) Following modified (preceding): Same like following (preceding), however if a cash flow gets shifted into a new month, then it is shifted to preceding (following) business day; (2) Shift/calculate (SC) and calculate/shift (CS). Accrual, principal, and possibly other calculations are affected by this choice. In the case of SC first the dates are shifted and after the shift cash flows are calculated. In the case of CS it is the other way round.</cmns-av:explanatoryNote>
		<cmns-av:explanatoryNote>Business day conventions commonly include:
- Following business day: Moves the date to the next business day
- Modified following business day: Moves the date to the next business day, unless it would fall in the next calendar month
- Preceding business day: Moves the date to the previous business day
- Modified preceding business day: Moves the date to the previous business day, unless it would fall in the previous calendar month</cmns-av:explanatoryNote>
		<cmns-av:explanatoryNote>The 2006 IDSA Definitions Section 4.11, provide the following examples: FRN Convention; Eurodollar Convention.
- If a payment date or period end date falls on a non-business day, it is moved to the next business day.
- If there is no numerically corresponding day in a calendar month, the payment date or period end date is moved to the last business day in that month.</cmns-av:explanatoryNote>
