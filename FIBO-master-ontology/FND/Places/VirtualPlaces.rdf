		<skos:changeNote>The http://www.omg.org/spec/EDMC-FIBO/FND/20141101/Places/VirtualPlaces.rdf version of this ontology was modified for the FIBO 2.0 RFC to integrate it with LCC.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/20180801/Places/VirtualPlaces.rdf version of this ontology was modified to eliminate duplication of concepts in LCC and email address and telephone number.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/20200301/Places/VirtualPlaces.rdf version of this ontology was modified to address hygiene issues with respect to text formatting.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/20220301/Places/VirtualPlaces.rdf version of the ontology was modified to use the Commons Ontology Library (Commons) Annotation Vocabulary rather than the OMG&apos;s Specification Metadata vocabulary.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/20230101/Places/VirtualPlaces.rdf version of this ontology was modified to use the Commons Ontology Library (Commons) rather than the OMG&apos;s Languages, Countries and Codes (LCC), eliminating redundancies in FIBO as appropriate.</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/20230301/Places/VirtualPlaces.rdf version of the ontology was modified to replace additional content that is now available in the OMG Commons Ontology Library (Commons) v1.2 (FND-389).</skos:changeNote>
		<skos:changeNote>This ontology was added to Foundations in advance of the December 2014 Long Beach meeting in support of the SEC specification.</skos:changeNote>

		<rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="&fibo-fnd-plc-adr;VirtualAddress"/>
		<rdfs:label>electronic mail address</rdfs:label>

		<cmns-av:explanatoryNote>Electronic mail, abbreviated e-mail or email, is a method of composing, sending, and receiving messages over electronic communication systems. The term e-mail applies both to the Internet e-mail system based on the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) and to intranet systems allowing users within one company or organization to send messages to each other. Often these workgroup collaboration systems natively use non-standard protocols but have some form of gateway to allow them to send and receive Internet e-mail. Some organizations may use the Internet protocols for internal e-mail service.</cmns-av:explanatoryNote>
